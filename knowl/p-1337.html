<div class="para">To this point, we have focused entirely on probability spaces <span class="process-math">\((S,P)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> a finite set. More generally, probability spaces are defined where <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is an infinite set. When <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is countably infinite, we can still define <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> on the members of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and now <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{x\in S} P(x)\)</span> is an infinite sum which converges absolutely (since all terms are non-negative) to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is uncountable, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is not defined on <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>  Instead, the probability function is defined on a family of subsets of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Given our emphasis on finite sets and combinatorics, we will discuss the first case briefly and refer students to texts that focus on general concepts from probability and statistics for the second.</div>
