<div class="para">Bob’s gotten really good at using augmenting paths to increase the value of a network flow. He’s not sure how to find them quite yet, but he knows a good thing when he sees it. He’s inclined to think that any augmenting path will be a good deal in his quest for a maximum-valued flow. Carlos is pleased about Bob’s enthusiasm for network flows but is beginning to think that he should warn Bob about the dangers in using just any old augmenting path to update a network flow. They agree that the best situation is when the number of updates that need to be made is small in terms of the number of vertices in the network and that the size of the capacities on the edges and the value of a maximum flow should not have a role in the number of updates.</div>
