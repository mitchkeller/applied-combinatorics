<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> is a transformation of the square with <span class="process-math">\(\tau^*(C_i) = C_j\text{,}\)</span> then we say colorings <span class="process-math">\(C_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_j\)</span> are <dfn class="terminology">equivalent</dfn> and write <span class="process-math">\(C_i\sim C_j\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\iota^*(C)=C\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(C\in\cgC\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is reflexive. If <span class="process-math">\(\tau_1^*(C_i) = C_j\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\tau_2^*(C_j) = C_k\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\tau_2^*(\tau_1^*(C_i)) = C_k\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is transitive. To complete our verification that <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation, we must establish that it is symmetric. For this, we require the notion of the <dfn class="terminology">inverse</dfn> of a transformation <span class="process-math">\(\tau\text{,}\)</span> which is simply the transformation <span class="process-math">\(\tau\inv\)</span> that undoes whatever <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> did. For instance, the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">counter</em>clockwise rotation by <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\text{,}\)</span> which has the same effect on the location of the vertices as <span class="process-math">\(r_3\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\tau^*(C_i) = C_j\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\({\tau^{-1}}^*(C_j) = C_i\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is symmetric.</div>
