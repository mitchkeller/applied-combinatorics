<div class="para">To see what this product represents, first consider how many ways can we get an <span class="process-math">\(x^6\text{?}\)</span> We could use the <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> from the first factor and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from each of the other four, or <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> from the second factor and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from each of the other four, etc., meaning that the coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(x^6\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(5 = C(5,4)\text{.}\)</span> More generally, what’s the coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(x^n\)</span> in the product? In the expansion, we get an <span class="process-math">\(x^n\)</span> for every product of the form <span class="process-math">\(x^{k_1}x^{k_2}x^{k_3}x^{k_4}x^{k_5}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4+k_5 = n\text{.}\)</span> Returning to the general question here, we’re really dealing with distributing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> apples to <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> children, and since <span class="process-math">\(k_i&gt; 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,5\text{,}\)</span> we also have the guarantee that each child receives at least one apple, so the product of the generating function for <em class="emphasis">one</em> child gives the generating function for <em class="emphasis">five</em> children.</div>
