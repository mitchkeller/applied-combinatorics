<div class="para">Undeterred, Bob notes that the comparability graph shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_compincomp.html" title="Figure 6.9">Figure 6.9</a> is also an incomparability graph (for another poset). He goes on to posit that this is always true, i.e., whenever <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is the comparability graph of a poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\text{,}\)</span> there is another poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfQ\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is the incomparability graph of <span class="process-math">\(\bfQ\text{.}\)</span> Alice says that Bob is right on the first count but she is not so sure about the second. Dave mumbles that they should take a look at the comparability graph of the third poset in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_constructposets.html" title="Figure 6.8">Figure 6.8</a>. This graph is not an incomparability graph. But in his typical befuddled manner, Dave doesn’t offer any justification for this statement. Can you help Alice and Bob to see why Dave is correct?</div>
