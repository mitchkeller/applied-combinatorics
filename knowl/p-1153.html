<div class="para">Finding a particular solution <span class="process-math">\(f_0\)</span> is a bit trickier than finding the general solution of the homogeneous equation. It’s something for which you can develop an intuition by solving lots of problems, but even with a good intuition for what to try, you’ll still likely find yourself having to try more than one thing on occasion in order to get a particular solution. What’s the best starting point for this intuition? It turns out that the best thing to try is usually (and not terribly surprisingly) something that looks a lot like the right hand side of the equation, but we will want to include one or more new constants to help us actually get a solution. Thus, here we try <span class="process-math">\(f_0(n) = d 3^n\text{.}\)</span> We have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
(A+2)(A-6)f_0(n) \amp = (A+2)(d3^{n+1}-6d3^n)\\
\amp  = (A+2)(-d3^{n+1})\\
\amp  = -d3^{n+2} -2d3^{n+1}\\
\amp  = -5d 3^{n+1}.
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">We want <span class="process-math">\(f_0\)</span> to be a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, meaning that <span class="process-math">\((A+2)(A-6)f_0 = 3^n\text{.}\)</span> This implies that we need to take <span class="process-math">\(d=-1/15\text{.}\)</span> Now, as we mentioned earlier, the general solution is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(n) = f_0(n) + f_1(n) = -\frac{1}{15}3^n + c_1 (-2)^n + c_2
6^n.
