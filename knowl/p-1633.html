<div class="para">In this chapter, we introduce a powerful enumeration technique generally referred to as Pólya’s enumeration theorem<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-24-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Pólya’s approach to counting allows us to use symmetries (such as those of geometric objects like polygons) to form generating functions. These generating functions can then be used to answer combinatorial questions such as</div>

<li><div class="para">How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using red, blue and green beads? What about <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span>-bead necklaces?</div></li>
