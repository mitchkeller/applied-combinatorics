<div class="para">A small-town bank robber is driving his getaway car from the bank he just robbed to his hideout. The bank is at the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(1^\text{st}\)</span> Street and <span class="process-math">\(1^\text{st}\)</span> Avenue. He needs to return to his hideout at the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(7^\text{th}\)</span> Street and <span class="process-math">\(5^\text{th}\)</span> Avenue. However, one of his lookouts has reported that the townâ€™s one police officer is parked at the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(4^\text{th}\)</span> Street and <span class="process-math">\(4^\text{th}\)</span> Avenue. Assuming that the bank robber does not want to get arrested and drives only on streets and avenues, in how many ways can he safely return to his hideout?  (Streets and avenues are uniformly spaced and numbered consecutively in this small town.)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_strings_exercises.html#exercise-27" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
