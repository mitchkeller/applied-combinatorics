Apply the First Fit coloring algorithm to <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> with this ordering on <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Now when the First Fit coloring algorithm colors <span class="process-math">\(v_i\text{,}\)</span> all of its neighbors have left end point at most <span class="process-math">\(a_i\text{.}\)</span> Since they are neighbors of <span class="process-math">\(v_i\text{,}\)</span> however, we know that their right endpoints are all at least <span class="process-math">\(a_i\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(v_i\)</span> and its previously-colored neighbors form a clique. Hence, <span class="process-math">\(v_i\)</span> is adjacent to at most <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG)-1\)</span> other vertices that have already been colored, so when the algorithm colors <span class="process-math">\(v_i\text{,}\)</span> there will be a color from <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\dots,\omega(\bfG)\}\)</span> not already in use on its neighbors. The algorithm will assign <span class="process-math">\(v_i\)</span> the smallest such color. Thus, we never need to use more than <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG)\)</span> colors, so <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG)=\omega(\bfG)\text{.}\)</span>
