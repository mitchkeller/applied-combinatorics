<div class="para">It was a slow day and Dave said he was bored. It was just after lunch, and he complained that there was nothing to do. Nobody really seemed to be listening, although Alice said that Dave might consider studying, even reading ahead in the chapter. Undeterred, Dave said “Hey Alice, how about we play a game. We could take turns tossing a coin, with the other person calling heads or tails. We could keep score with the first one to a hundred being the winner.” Alice rolled her eyes at such a lame idea. Sensing Alice’s lack of interest, Dave countered “OK, how about a hundred games of Rock, Paper or Scissors?” Zori said “Why play a hundred times? If that’s what you’re going to do, just play a single game.”</div>
