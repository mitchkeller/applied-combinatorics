<div class="para">Alice and Bob are talking about how you communicate with a computer in working with posets. Bob says that computers have incredible graphics capabilities these days and that you just give the computer a pdf scan of a diagram. Alice says that she doubts that anybody really does that. Carlos says that there are several effective strategies. One way is to label the points with positive integers from <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of points in the ground set and then define a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>â€“<span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with entry <span class="process-math">\(a(i,j)=1\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(i\le j\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a(i,j)=0\)</span> otherwise. Alternatively, you can just provide for each element <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> in the ground set a vector <span class="process-math">\(U(x)\)</span> listing all elements which are greater than <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> This vector can be what computer scientists call a <dfn class="terminology">linked list</dfn>.</div>
