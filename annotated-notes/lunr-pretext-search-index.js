How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant?      How many license plates end with a -digit number divisible by ?

How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant or end with a -digit number divisible by ?        How many ways are there to form a string of length 10 using symbols from the 26-letter uppercase English alphabet if exactly three characters in the string are to elements of the set ? Write a sentence or two to explain your reasoning.    We first choose three places for the letters from , which can be done in ways. We then have four choices for each of those positions, so there are ways to fill them in. Finally, we must fill in the remaining 7 positions using the other 22 letters. There are no restrictions on repetition, so there are ways to fill in those spaces. Thus, the total number of strings is .      How does your answer change if the characters from the set must be distinct?    Instead of we have since the number of options for each of those positions decreases by one after making the previous decision.      Peer instruction question 1   We saw this sum on the handout during our last class:      A square grid of dots. There are 7 rows, each containing 7 dots. There is a box surrounding the dots lying on the diagonal that runs from the upper-left corner of the grid to the lower-right corner of the grid.                   Dots below the box:     Total dots:     Dots in the box:     Dots outside the box:     Dots below the box: since half the dots outside the box are below it and half are above it.    How do the answers to the five bullets above change when the grid is ?  Replace by and by . Then the number of dots below the box is as well as .        We just saw that .

There are options that can be paired with 1 to make a 2-element set with as the least element since the largest option we have is . Working through in general, we see that there are 2-element subsets of having as the least element, and that least element can be anything from to . Since each 2-element subset has a unique element, if we sum , we are counting the 2-element subsets of grouped by their smallest element, so the sum equals .

  "body": " Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients     Find a simple formula for . By a simple formula, I mean one without a summation in it. One way to do this is to think about something that's being counted and find a \"better\" way to count it.       Think of a committee (or team) with a chair (or captain).    Remember that        We start by rewriting the summation as . Now we can think of this as a situation where we have students from Wisconsin and students from Minnesota. We need to choose a team of size , and there is some obscure state law requiring that the captain of the team be from Wisconsin. The summation groups the ways of choosing such a team by the number of students from Wisconsin on the team. Looking at the final formulation, we see that there are ways to choose Wisconsinites for the team, then ways to choose one of those students to be the captain, and then we still need another students for the team chosen from the Minnesotans in one of ways. An alternative way to think of this is to first choose the Wisconsinite to be captain, which can be done in ways, and then just choosing any of the remaining students to be on the team. There are ways to make that choice, and thus the summation must be equal to .  If you prefer thinking about strings, we can take a different approach. Suppose we wish to make strings of length with the restriction that the string contain a single that must appear in the first positions of the string along with positions that are and positions that are . In this model, there are choices for where the goes and then we must choose of the other positions to fill in with (and then the rest get filled with ). That can be done in ways. We can connect this to the summation by having represent the number of positions in the first positions of the string that are nonzero. Once we choose which of those are nonzero, we have to pick one of those positions to make a and fill the others with s.
