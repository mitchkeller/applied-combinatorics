<div class="para">Now it was Alice’s turn. “If you want to play a game, I’ve got a good one for you. Just as you wanted, first one to score a hundred wins. You roll a pair of dice. If you roll doubles, I win <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> points. If the two dice have a difference of one, I win <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> point.  If the difference is <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> then it’s a tie. If the difference is <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> you win one point; if the difference is <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> you win two points; and if the difference is <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> you win three points.” Xing interrupted to say “In other words, if the difference is <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> then Dave wins <span class="process-math">\(d-2\)</span> points.” Alice continues “Right! And there are three ways Dave can win, with one of them being the biggest prize of all. Also, rolling doubles is rare, so this has to be a good game for Dave.”</div>
