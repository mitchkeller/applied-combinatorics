<div class="para">At the end of the section, we’ll briefly look at a theorem on matchings in bipartite graphs that tells us precisely when an assignment of workers to jobs exists that ensures each worker has a job. First, however, we want to see how network flows can be used to find maximum matchings in bipartite graphs. The algorithm we give, while decent, is not the most efficient algorithm known for this problem. Therefore, it is not likely to be the one used in practice. However, it is a nice example of how network flows can be used to solve a combinatorial problem. The network that we use is formed from a bipartite graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> by placing an edge from the source <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to each vertex of <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and an edge from each vertex of <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> to the sink <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> The edges between <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> are oriented from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{,}\)</span> and <em class="emphasis">every</em> edge is given capacity <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flowapplications_bipmatch_network.html" title="Figure 14.4">Figure 14.4</a> contains the network corresponding to our graph from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flowapplications_bip_graph.html" title="Figure 14.2">Figure 14.2</a>.
