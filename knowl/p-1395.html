<div class="para">Carlos said that he had been trying to prove a good lower bound on <span class="process-math">\(R(n,n)\)</span> using only constructive methods, i.e., no random techniques allowed. But he was having problems. Anything he tried seemed only to show that <span class="process-math">\(R(n,n)\ge n^c\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a constant. That seems so weak compared to the exponential bound which the probabilistic method gives easily. Usually Alice was not very sympathetic to the complaints of others and certainly not from Carlos, who seemed always to be out front.  But this time, Alice said to Carlos and in a manner that all could hear “Maybe you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself. I read an article on the web that nobody has been able to show that there is a constant <span class="process-math">\(c&gt;1\)</span> and an integer <span class="process-math">\(n_0\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(R(n,n)&gt;c^n\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;n_0\text{,}\)</span> provided that only constructive methods are allowed.  And maybe, just maybe, saying that you are unable to do something that lots of other famous people seem also unable to do is not so bad.” Bob saw a new side of Alice and this too wasn’t all bad.</div>
