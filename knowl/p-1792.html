<div class="para">So the question is whether, regardless of their respective preferences, we can always generate a stable matching. The answer is yes and there is a quite clever argument. In fact, it is one that yields a quite efficient algorithm.  At StageÂ 1, all males go knock on the front door of the female which is tops on their list. It may happen that some females have more than one caller while others have none. However, if a female has one or more males at her door, she reaches out and grabs the one among the group which she prefers most by the collar and tells the others, if there are any, to go away. Any male rejected at this step proceeds to the front door of the female who is second on their list. Again, a female with one or more suitors at her door chooses the best among then and sends the others away. This process continues until eventually, each female is holding onto exactly one male.</div>
