<div class="para">Dave was on a roll. He asked, “Who has change for a dollar?” but nobody understood why he would derail an argument over proofs when everybody had already paid for the coffee. Alice was more to the point “You know Dave, sometimes I just don’t understand why you say the things you do.” Dave smiled (maybe it was more of a smirk) “It’s about making change. The terms in this sequence are the fewest number of coins required to make change.” Bob said “I don’t get it.” Dave continued “The term <span class="process-math">\(a_n\)</span> is the fewest number of U.S. coins required to total to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents.” Now everyone groaned, everyone except Carlos, who thought that at least this time, Dave was really clever.</div>
