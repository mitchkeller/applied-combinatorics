<div class="para">Over coffee, Xing said that he had been experimenting with the SageMath software discussed in <a href="ch_intro.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: An Introduction to Combinatorics">Chapter 1</a>.  He understood that SageMath was treating a big integer as a string.  Xing enthusiastically reported that he had asked SageMath to find the sum <span class="process-math">\(a+b\)</span> of two large integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> each having more than <span class="process-math">\(800\)</span> digits. The software found the answer about as fast as he could hit the enter key on his netbook.  “That’s not so impressive,” Alice interjected.  “A human, even Bob, could do this in a couple of minutes using pencil and paper.”</div>
