<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\sigma=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_{mn+1})\)</span> be a sequence of <span class="process-math">\(mn+1\)</span> distinct real numbers. For each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,mn+1\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> be the maximum number of terms in a increasing subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> the first term. Also, let <span class="process-math">\(b_i\)</span> be the maximum number of terms in a decreasing subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> the last term. If there is some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(a_i\ge m+1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> has an increasing subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(m+1\)</span> terms. Conversely, if for some <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(b_i\ge n+1\text{,}\)</span> then we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> has a decreasing subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> terms.</div> <div class="para">It remains to consider the case where <span class="process-math">\(a_i\le m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_i\le n\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,mn+1\text{.}\)</span> Since there are <span class="process-math">\(mn\)</span> ordered pairs of the form <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(1\le a\le m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\le b\le n\text{,}\)</span> we conclude from the Pigeon Hole principle that there must be integers <span class="process-math">\(i_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(i_2\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1\le i_1\lt i_2\le mn+1\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\((a_{i_1},b_{i_1})=(a_{i_2},b_{i_2})\text{.}\)</span>  Since <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_2}\)</span> are distinct, we either have <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_1}\lt x_{i_2}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_1}&gt;x_{i_2}\text{.}\)</span> In the first case, any increasing subsequence with <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_2}\)</span> as its first term can be extended by prepending <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_1}\)</span> at the start.
