<div class="para">Clearly aggravated, Zori said “I’ve had all I can stand of this big integer stuff. This won’t help me to earn a living.” Xing now was uncharacteristically firm in his reply “Zori.  You’re off base on this issue. Large integers, and specifically integers which are the product of large primes, are central to public key cryptography.
