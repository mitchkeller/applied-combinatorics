<div class="para">In the third grade, you were probably told that <span class="process-math">\(5 =\frac{5}{1}\text{,}\)</span> but by now you are realizing that this is not exactly true.  Similarly, if you had told your teacher that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{6}{8}\)</span> weren’t really the same and were only “equal” in the broader sense of an equivalence relation defined on a subset of the cartesian product of the integers, you probably would have been sent to the Principal’s office.</div>
