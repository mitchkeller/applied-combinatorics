    <title>The Binomial Theorem</title>
    <p>Here is a truly basic result from combinatorics kindergarten.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_binomial">
        <title>Binomial Theorem</title>

        <idx><h>binomial coefficient</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be real numbers with <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>x+y</m> non-zero.  Then for every non-negative integer <m>n</m>,
            <me>
                (x+y)^n=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\binom{n}{i}x^{n-i}y^{i}.
            </me>
            </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
            <p>View <m>(x+y)^n</m> as a product
            <me>
                (x+y)^n=\underbrace{(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\dots(x+y)(x+y)}_{n\text{&#xA0;factors} }.
            </me>
            Each term of the expansion of the product results from choosing either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> from one of these factors. If <m>x</m> is chosen <m>n-i</m> times and <m>y</m> is chosen <m>i</m> times, then the resulting product is <m>x^{n-i}y^i</m>. Clearly, the number of such terms is <m>C(n,i)</m>, <ie />, out of the <m>n</m> factors, we choose the element <m>y</m> from <m>i</m> of them, while we take <m>x</m> in the remaining <m>n-i</m>.
            </p>
        </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <example>
        <p>There are times when we are interested not in the full expansion of a power of a binomial, but just the coefficient on one of the terms. The <xref ref="thm_binomial" text="title" /> gives that the coefficient of <m>x^5y^8</m> in <m>(2x-3y)^{13}</m> is <m>\binom{13}{5}2^{5}(-3)^8</m>.
