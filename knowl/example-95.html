<div class="para">Many states have lotteries to finance college scholarships or other public enterprises judged to have value to the public at large. Although far from a scientific investigation, it seems on the basis of our investigation that many of the games have an expected value of approximately fifty cents when one dollar is invested. So the games are far from fair, and no one should play them unless they have an intrinsic desire to support the various causes for which the lottery profits are targeted.</div> <div class="para">By contrast, various games of chance played in gambling centers have an expected return of slightly less than ninety cents for every dollar wagered. In this setting, we can only say that one has to place a dollar value on the enjoyment derived from the casino environment. From a mathematical standpoint, you are going to lose. Thatâ€™s how they get the money to build those exotic buildings.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_probability_discrete-random-variables.html#example-95" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
