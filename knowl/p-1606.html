<div class="para">Now that we know we have a maximum flow, we’d like to be able to argue that the matching we’ve found is also maximum. After all, the boss isn’t going to be happy if he later finds out that this fancy algorithm you claimed gave an optimal assignment of jobs to workers left the fifth worker (<span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span>) without a job when all six of them could have been put to work. Let’s take a look at which vertices were labeled by the Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm on the last run. There were three vertices (<span class="process-math">\(x_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_4\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span>) from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> labeled, while there were only two vertices (<span class="process-math">\(y_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_5\)</span>) from <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> labeled. Notice that <span class="process-math">\(y_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_5\)</span> are the only vertices that are neighbors of <span class="process-math">\(x_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_4\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> Thus, no matter how we choose the matching edges from <span class="process-math">\(\{x_3,x_4,x_5\}\text{,}\)</span> one of these vertices will be left unsaturated. Therefore, one of the workers must go without a job assignment. (In our example, it’s the fifth, but it’s possible to choose different edges for the matching so another one of them is left without a task.)</div>
