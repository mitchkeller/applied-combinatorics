<div class="para">Similarly, we say that a graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">cover graph</dfn> when there exists a poset <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> whose cover graph is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> Not every graph is a cover graph. In particular, any graph which contains a triangle is not a cover graph. In the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will be asked to construct triangle-free graphs which are not cover graphsâ€”with some hints given as to how to proceed.</div>
