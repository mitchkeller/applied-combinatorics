<div class="para">We’ll continue our discussion of the history of the Four Color Theorem in a moment, but first, we must consider how we can turn the problem of coloring a map into a graph theory question. Well, it seems natural that each region should be assigned a corresponding vertex. We want to force regions that share a boundary to have different colors, so this suggests that we should place an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding regions have a common boundary. (As an example, the map in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_needs-four-colors.html" title="Figure 5.36">Figure 5.36</a> corresponds to the graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_4\text{.}\)</span>) It is not difficult to see that this produces a planar graph, since we may draw the edges through the common boundary segment. Furthermore, with a little bit of thought, you should see that given a planar drawing of a graph, you can create a map in which each vertex leads to a region and edges lead to common boundary segments. Thus, the Four Color Problem could be stated as “Does every planar graph have chromatic number at most four?”</div>
