<div class="para">The other notable update in this edition is the addition of a number of SageMathCells to <a href="ch_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Generating Functions">Chapter 8</a> (including in the exercises), <a href="s_recurrence_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.6: Using generating functions to solve recurrences">Section 9.6</a>, and the Discussion that ends <a href="ch_recurrence.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 9: Recurrence Equations">Chapter 9</a>. The practice of vaguely referring readers to a generic computer algebra system but not providing any advice on how to use it had always been unsatisfying. I know there are places where further refinement is in order, but this edition starts a more coherent approach toward using technology for some of the unpleasant algebraic aspects of the text. Readers can edit the content of the SageMathCells in the body of the text in order to use them to tackle other problems, and those in the exercises are there for convenience more than anything and include only a bare skeleton of what might be useful for the exercise. Since SageMath is open source and can be run for free on CoCalc, this approach seems greatly preferable to targeting a commercial CAS. <em class="alert">For those, like me, who are coming to SageMath  with experience using a commercial CAS, SageMath does not do implied multiplication in input very well. When a result comes up that seems strange, my first step is always to make sure that I’m not missing a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code> in my code.</em>
