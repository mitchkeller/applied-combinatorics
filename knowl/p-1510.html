<div class="para">Bob and Xing are considering this situation, and Bob suggests that a little modification to the algorithm should solve the problem. He says that if there are negative weights, they just have to find the smallest (i.e., most negative weight) and add the absolute value of that weight to every directed edge. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(w(x,y)\geq -10\)</span> for every directed edge <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{,}\)</span> Bob is suggesting that they add <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> to every edge weight. Xing is skeptical, and for good reason. Give an example to show why Bob’s modification won’t work.</div>
