<div class="para">Imagine placing the <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it’s been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are <span class="process-math">\(26^6\)</span> strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string “yellow” has six characters, but it uses the letter “l” twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, “jacket” can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are <span class="process-math">\(25\)</span> letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are <span class="process-math">\(21\)</span> letters in the bag. Thus, we can form <span class="process-math">\(26\cdot 25\cdot 24\cdot 23\cdot 22\cdot 21\)</span> six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_strings_permutations.html#exa_strings_perm" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
