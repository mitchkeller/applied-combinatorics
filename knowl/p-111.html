<div class="para">You likely have already been introduced to optimization problems, as calculus students around the world are familiar with the plight of farmers trying to fence the largest area of land given a certain amount of fence or people needing to cross rivers downstream from their current location who must decide where they should cross based on the speed at which they can run and swim. However, these problems are inherently continuous. In theory, you can cross the river at any point you want, even if it were irrational. (OK, so not exactly irrational, but a good decimal approximation.) In this course, we will examine a few optimization problems that are not continuous, as only integer values for the variables will make sense. It turns out that many of these problems are very hard to solve in general.</div>
