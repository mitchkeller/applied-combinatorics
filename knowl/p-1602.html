<div class="para">Now that we have translated a bipartite graph into a network, we need to address the correspondence between matchings and network flows. To turn a matching <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> into a network flow, we start by placing one unit of flow on the edges of the matching. To have a valid flow, we must also place one unit of flow on the edges from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> saturated by <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Since each of these vertices is incident with a single edge of <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> the flow out of each of them is <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> matching the flow in. Similarly, routing one unit of flow to <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from each of the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> saturated by <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> takes care of the conservation laws for the remaining vertices. To go the other direction, simply note that the full edges from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> in an integer-valued flow is a matching. Thus, we can find a maximum matching from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> by simply running the labeling algorithm on the associated network in order to find a maximum flow.</div>
