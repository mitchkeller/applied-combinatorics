            <p>Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a <m>9\times 9</m> grid. The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses PÃ³lya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of <em>games</em> is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)</p>

                        <li><p>Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the <m>9\times 9</m> grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group <m>D_8</m> that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in <xref ref="fig_polya_TTT" />. For example, the effect of the transformation <m>r_1</m>, which rotates the board <m>90^\circ</m> clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as <m>(13971)(2684)(5)</m>.</p>
                        <p>Write each of the eight elements of <m>D_8</m> as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Find the cycle index of <m>D_8</m> in terms of these permutations.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Make an appropriate substitution for <m>x_i</m> in the cycle index to find a generating function <m>t(X,O)</m> in which the coefficient on <m>X^iO^j</m> is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having <m>i</m> squares filled by symbol X and <m>j</m> squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)</p></li>
                        <li><p>How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?</p></li>
                        <li><p>How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?</p></li>
                        <li><p>When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and <m>t(X,O)</m> to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.</p></li>

            <p>Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color. </p>

        <hint>
            <p>It may be helpful to label the faces as <m>U</m> (<q>up</q>), <m>D</m> (<q>down</q>), <m>F</m> (<q>front</q>), <m>B</m> (<q>back</q>), <m>L</m> (<q>left</q>), and <m>R</m> (<q>right</q>) instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.</p>
