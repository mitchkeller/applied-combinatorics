<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">Sudoku puzzle</dfn> is a <span class="process-math">\(9\times 9\)</span> array of cells that when completed have the integers <span class="process-math">\(1,2,\dots,9\)</span> appearing exactly once in each row and each column. Also (and this is what makes the puzzles so fascinating), the numbers <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3,\dots,9\)</span> appear once in each of the nine <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> subsquares identified by the darkened borders. To be considered a legitimate Sudoku puzzle, there should be a <em class="emphasis">unique</em> solution. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sudoku.html" title="Figure 1.22">Figure 1.22</a>, we show two Sudoku puzzles. The one on the right is fairly easy, and the one on the left is far more challenging.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 93%; margin-left: 3.5%; margin-right: 3.5%;"><img src="external/mysudoku.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

Also, you can find Sudoku puzzles on the web at: <a class="external" href="http://www.websudoku.com" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">http://www.websudoku.com</code></a>.  On this site, the “Evil” ones are just that.</div> <div class="para">How does Rory make up good Sudoku puzzles, ones that are difficult for Mandy to solve? How could Mandy use a computer to solve puzzles that Rory has constructed?  What makes some Sudoku puzzles easy and some of them hard?</div> <div class="para">The size of a Sudoku puzzle can be expanded in an obvious way, and many newspapers include a <span class="process-math">\(16\times16\)</span> Sudoku puzzle in their Sunday edition (just next to a challenging crosswords puzzle).
