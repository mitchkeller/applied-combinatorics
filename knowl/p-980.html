<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Note that there are <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> partitions of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> into <em class="emphasis">distinct</em> parts. Also there are <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> partitions of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> into <em class="emphasis">odd</em> parts. While it might seem that this is a coincidence, it in fact is always the case as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_partition.html" title="Theorem 8.16">Theorem 8.16</a> states. Before looking at that theorem and its proof, let’s think about what a generating function for <span class="process-math">\(p_n\text{,}\)</span> the number of partitions of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> would look like. Given a partition of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we can count how many <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>’s appear, how many <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>’s appear, and so on. This suggests a similarity with our fruit basket problems earlier in the chapter, leading to the generating function</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/thm_partition.html">
\begin{equation*}
P(x) = \left(\sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{m}\right)\left(\sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{2m}\right)         \left(\sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{3m}\right)\cdots         \left(\sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{km}\right)\cdots = \prod_{m=1}^\infty\frac{1}{1-x^m}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Here the factor whose sum contains terms <span class="process-math">\(x^{km}\)</span> is accounting for the number of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>’s in the partition. While <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> has a quite elegant form, that doesn’t mean that it’s terribly useful for computing <span class="process-math">\(p_n\text{.}\)</span> In fact, providing an asymptotic estimate for <span class="process-math">\(p_n\)</span> was a notoriously difficult problem, finally addressed by Hardy and Ramanujan in 1918. A popular account of this can be found in Robert Kanigel’s 1991 book <span class="booktitle">The Man who Knew Infinity</span> or the 2016 film with the same title.</div>
