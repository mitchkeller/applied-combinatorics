<div class="para">Benzene is a chemical compound with formula <span class="process-math">\(\text{C} _6\text{H} _6\text{,}\)</span> meaning it consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. These atoms are bonded in such a way that the six carbon atoms form a hexagonal ring with alternating single and double bonds. A hydrogen atom is bonded to each carbon atom (on the outside of the ring). From benzene it is possible to form other chemical compounds that are part of a family known as <dfn class="terminology">aromatic hydrocarbons</dfn>. These compounds are formed by replacing one or more of the hydrogen atoms by atoms of other elements or functional groups such as <span class="process-math">\(\text{CH} _3\)</span> (methyl group) or <span class="process-math">\(\text{OH}\)</span> (hydroxyl group). Because there are six choices for which hydrogen atoms to replace, molecules with the same chemical formula but different structures can be formed in this manner. Such molecules are called <dfn class="terminology">isomers</dfn>. In this subsection, we will see how <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_polya_polya.html" title="Theorem 15.11: Pólya’s Enumeration Theorem">Pólya’s Enumeration Theorem</a> can be used to determine the number of isomers of the aromatic hydrocarbon xylenol (also known as dimethylphenol).</div>
