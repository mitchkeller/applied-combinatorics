<div class="para">Now suppose that the vertices are locations of branch banks in Atlanta and that the weights on an edge represents the cost, in millions of dollars, of building a high capacity data link between the branch banks at it two end points. In this model, if there is no edge between two branch banks, it means that the cost of building a data link between this particular pair is prohibitively high (here we might be tempted to say the cost is infinite, but the authors donâ€™t admit to knowing the meaning of this word).</div>
