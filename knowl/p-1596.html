<div class="para">Notice that the above theorem does not guarantee that every maximum flow has integer flow on every edge, just that we are able to find one. With this theorem in hand, we now see that if we consider network flow problems in which the capacities are all <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> we can find a maximum flow in which every edge carries a flow of either <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> This can give us a combinatorial interpretation of the flow, in a sense using the full edges as edges that we “take” in some useful sense.</div>
