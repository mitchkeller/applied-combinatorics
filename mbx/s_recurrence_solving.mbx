<title>Solving advancement operator
  equations</title>


<introduction>
<p>
In this section, we will explore some ways of solving advancement
operator equations. Some we will make up just for the sake of solving,
while others will be drawn from the examples we developed in
<xref ref="s_recurrence_intro" autoname="yes" />. Again, readers familiar with
differential equations will notice many similarities between the
techniques used here and those used to solve linear differential
equations with constant coefficients, but we will not give any further
examples to make those parallels explicit.
</p>
</introduction>


<subsection xml:id="s_recurrence_solving_homogeneous">
<title>Homogeneous equations</title>
<p>
Homogeneous equations, it will turn out, can be solved using very
explicit methodology that will work any time we can find the roots of
a polynomial. Let's start with another fairly straightforward example.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex_recurrence_deg2">
<statement>
<p>
Find all solutions to the advancement operator equation
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_recurrence_deg2" >
  (A^2+A-6)f = 0.
</men>
<p>
Before focusing on finding <em>all</em> solutions as we've been asked
to do, let's just try to find <em>some</em> solution. We start by noticing
that here <m>p(A) = A^2+A-6 = (A+3)(A-2)</m>. With <m>p(A)</m> factored like
this, we realize that we've already solved part of this problem in
<xref ref="ex_recurrence_adveq">Example</xref>!
In that example, the polynomial of <m>A</m> we encountered was (while not
explicitly stated as such there) <m>A-2</m>. The solutions to <m>(A-2)f_1=0</m>
are of the form <m>f_1(n) = c_12^n</m>. What happens if we try such a
function here? We have
</p>
<me>
  (A+3)(A-2)f_1(n) = (A+3)0 = 0,
</me>
<p>
so that <m>f_1</m> is a solution to our given advancement operator
equation. Of course, it can't be <em>all</em> of them. However, it's
not hard to see now that <m>(A+3)f_2 = 0</m> has as a solution <m>f_2(n) =
  c_2(-3)^n</m> by the same reasoning that we used in
<xref ref="ex_recurrence_adveq">Example</xref>. Since
<m>(A+3)(A-2) = (A-2)(A+3)</m>, we see right away that <m>f_2</m> is also a
solution of <xref ref="eqn_recurrence_deg2" autoname="yes" />.
</p>

<p>
Now we've got two infinite families of solutions to
<xref ref="eqn_recurrence_deg2" autoname="yes" />. Do they give us <em>all</em> the
solutions? It turns out that by combining them, they do in fact give
all of the solutions. Consider what happens if we take <m>f(n) = c_1
  2^n + c_2 (-3)^n</m> and apply <m>p(A)</m> to it. We have
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A+3)(A-2)f(n) \amp  = (A+3)(c_1 2^{n+1} + c_2 (-3)^{n+1} - 2(c_12^n +
    c_2(-3)^n))</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+3)(-5c_2(-3)^{n})</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = -5c_2(-3)^{n+1}-15c_2(-3)^n</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 15c_2(-3)^n - 15c_2(-3)^n</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =0.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
It's not all that hard to see that since <m>f</m> gives a two-parameter family of
solutions to <xref ref="eqn_recurrence_deg2" autoname="yes" />, it gives us all the
solutions, as we will show in detail in <xref ref="s_recurrence_rigorous" autoname="yes" />.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
What happened in this example is far from a fluke. If you have an
advancement operator equation of the form <m>p(A)f=0</m> (the constant term
of <m>p</m> nonzero) and <m>p</m> has degree <m>k</m>, then the <em>general
solution</em> of <m>p(A)f=0</m> will be a <m>k</m>-parameter family (in the
previous example, our parameters are the constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>)
whose terms come from solutions to simpler equations arising from the
factors of <m>p</m>. We'll return to this thought in a little bit, but
first let's look at another example.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex_recurrence_ternary-strings-no-20-solved">
<statement>
<p>
Let's revisit the problem of enumerating ternary strings of length
<m>n</m> that do have <m>(2,0)</m> occurring as a substring in two consecutive
positions that we encountered in
<xref ref="ex_recurrence_ternary-strings-no-20">Example</xref>. There
we saw that this number satisfies the recurrence equation
</p>
<me>
  t_{n+2} = 3t_{n+1} - t_n,\qquad n\geq 1
</me>
<p>
and <m>t_1 = 3</m> and <m>t_2=8</m>. Before endeavoring to solve this, let's
rewrite our recurrence equation as an advancement operator
equation. This gives us
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_recurrence_ternary" >
  p(A)t=(A^2-3A+1)t=0.
</men>
<p>
The roots of <m>p(A)</m> are <m>(3\pm\sqrt{5})/2</m>. Following the approach
of the previous example, our general solution is
</p>
<me>
  t(n) = c_1\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n +
  c_2\left(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n.
</me>
<p>
This probably looks suspicious; we're <em>counting strings</em> here,
so <m>t(n)</m> needs to be a nonnegative integer, but the form we've
given includes not just fractions but also square roots! However,
if you look carefully, you'll see that using the binomial theorem to
expand the terms in our expression for <m>t(n)</m> would get rid of all
the square roots, so everything is good. (A faster way to convince
yourself that this really satisfies <xref ref="eqn_recurrence_ternary" autoname="yes" />
is to mimic the verification we used in the previous example.)
Because we have initial values for <m>t(n)</m>, we are able to solve for
<m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> here. Evaluating at <m>n=0</m> and <m>n=1</m> we get
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  3 \amp = c_1 + c_2</mrow>
  <mrow>  8 \amp  = c_1\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2} + c_2 \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
A little bit of computation gives
</p>
<me>
  c_1 = \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{10} + \frac{3}{2} \quad\text{and} \quad c_2 =
  -\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{10} +\frac{3}{2}
</me>
<p>
so that
</p>
<me>
  t(n) = \left(\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{10} + \frac{3}{2}\right)
  \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n+ \left(-\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{10}
    +\frac{3}{2}\right) \left(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n.
</me>
</statement>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Find the general solution to the advancement operator equation
</p>
<me>
  (A+1)(A-6)(A+4)f = 0.
</me>
<p>
By now, you shouldn't be surprised that we immediately make use of
the roots of <m>p(A)</m> and have that the solution is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = c_1(-1)^n + c_2 6^n + c_3 (-4)^n.
</me>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
By now, you should be able to see most of the pattern for solving
homogeneous advancement operator equations. However, the examples
we've considered thus far have all had one thing in common: the roots
of <m>p(A)</m> were all distinct. Solving advancement operator equations in
which this is not the case is not much harder than what we've done so
far, but we do need to treat it as a distinct case.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex_recurrence_deg2-repeated">
<statement>
<p>
Find the general solution of the advancement operator equation
</p>
<me>
  (A-2)^2 f=0.
</me>
<p>
Here we have the repeated root problem that we mentioned a moment
ago. We see immediately that <m>f_1(n) = c_12^n</m> is a solution to this
equation, but that can't be all, as we mentioned earlier that we
must have a <m>2</m>-parameter family of solutions to such an
equation. You might be tempted to try <m>f_2(n) = c_2 2^n</m> and <m>f(n) =
  f_1(n) + f_2(n)</m>, but then this is just <m>(c_1+c_2)2^n</m>, which is
really just a single parameter, <m>c=c_1+c_2</m>.
</p>

<p>
What can we do to resolve this conundrum? What if we tried <m>f_2(n) =
  c_2 n2^n</m>? Again, if you're familiar with differential equations,
this would be the analogous thing to try, so let's give it a
shot. Let's apply <m>(A-2)^2</m> to this <m>f_2</m>. We have
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A-2)^2 f_2(n) \amp = (A-2)(c_2(n+1)2^{n+1} - 2c_2 n2^n)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A-2)(c_2 2^{n+1})</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = c_22^{n+2} - 2c_2 2^{n+1}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 0.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Since <m>f_2</m> satisfies our advancement operator equation, we have
that the general solution is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = c_1 2^n + c_2 n2^n.
</me>
</statement>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex_recurrence_deg4-repeated">
<statement>
<p>
Consider the recurrence equation
</p>
<me>
  f_{n+4} = -2f_{n+3} + 12f_{n+2} + -14 f_{n+1} + 5f_n
</me>
<p>
with initial conditions <m>f_0 = 1</m>, <m>f_1= 2</m>, <m>f_2 = 4</m>, and <m>f_3 =
  4</m>. Find an explicit formula for <m>f_n</m>.
</p>

<p>
We again start by writing the given recurrence equation as an
advancement operator equation for a function <m>f(n)</m>:
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_recurrence_deg4-repeated" >
  (A^4 +2A^3 -12A^2+14A-5)f = 0.
</men>
<p>
Factoring <m>p(A) = A^4 +2A^3 -12A^2+14A-5</m> gives <m>p(A) =
  (A+5)(A-1)^3</m>. Right away, we see that <m>f_1(n) = c_1 (-5)^n</m> is a
solution. The previous example should have you convinced that
<m>f_2(n) = c_2\cdot 1^n = c_2</m> and <m>f_3(n) = c_3 n \cdot 1^n = c_3 n</m>
are also solutions, and it's not likely to surprise you when we
suggest trying <m>f_4(n) = c_4 n^2</m> as another solution. To verify
that it works, we see
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A+5)(A-1)^3 f_4(n) \amp = (A+5)(A-1)^2(c_4(n+1)^2 - c_4 n^2)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+5)(A-1)^2 (2c_4 n + c_4)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+5)(A-1)(2c_4(n+1) + c_4 - 2c_4 n -c_4)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+5)(A-1)(2c_4)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+5)(2c_4-2c_4)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 0.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Thus, the general solution is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = c_1 (-5)^n + c_2 + c_3 n + c_4n^2.
</me>
<p>
Since we have initial conditions, we see that

<md>
  <mrow>  1= f(0) \amp  = c_1+c_2</mrow>
  <mrow>  2 = f(1) \amp  = -5c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4</mrow>

  <mrow>  4 = f(3) \amp  = -125c_1 + c_2 +3c_3 +9c_4</mrow>
</md>
<p>
is a system of equations whose solution gives the values for the
<m>c_i</m>. Solving this system gives that the desired solution is

  f(n) = \frac{1}{72} (-5)^n +\frac{71}{72} + \frac{5}{6} n +\frac{1}{4} n^2.

<subsection xml:id="s_recurrence_solving_nonhomogeneous">
<title>Nonhomogeneous equations</title>
<p>
As we mentioned earlier, nonhomogeneous equations are a bit trickier
than solving homogeneous equations, and sometimes our first attempt at
a solution will not be successful but will suggest a better function
to try. Before we're done, we'll revisit the problem of lines in the
plane that we've considered a couple of times, but let's start with a
more illustrative example.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the advancement operator equation
</p>
<me>
  (A+2)(A-6)f=3^n.
</me>
<p>
Let's try to find the general solution to this, since once we have
that, we could find the specific solution corresponding to any given
set of initial conditions.
</p>

<p>
When dealing with nonhomogeneous equations, we proceed in two
steps. The reason for this will be made clear in
<xref ref="lem_particular">Lemma</xref>, but let's
focus on the method for the moment. Our first step is to find the
general solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding to the
given nonhomogeneous equation. In this case, the homogeneous
equation we want to solve is
</p>
<me>
  (A+2)(A-6)f=0,
</me>
<p>
for which by now you should be quite comfortable in rattling off a
general solution of
</p>
<me>
  f_1(n) = c_1 (-2)^n + c_2 6^n.
</me>
<p>
Now for the process of actually dealing with the nonhomogeneity of
the advancement operator equation. It actually suffices to find
<em>any</em> solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, which we will
call a <em>particular</em> solution. Once we have a particular
solution <m>f_0</m> to the equation, the general solution is simply
<m>f=f_0 + f_1</m>, where <m>f_1</m> is the general solution to the
homogeneous equation.
</p>

<p>
Finding a particular solution <m>f_0</m> is a bit trickier than finding
the general solution of the homogeneous equation. It's something for
which you can develop an intuition by solving lots of problems, but
even with a good intuition for what to try, you'll still likely find
yourself having to try more than one thing on occasion in order to
get a particular solution. What's the best starting point for this
intuition? It turns out that the best thing to try is usually (and
not terribly surprisingly) something that looks a lot like the right
hand side of the equation, but we will want to include one or more
new constants
to help us actually get a solution. Thus, here we try <m>f_0(n) = d 3^n</m>. We
have
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A+2)(A-6)f_0(n) \amp = (A+2)(d3^{n+1}-6d3^n)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A+2)(-d3^{n+1})</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = -d3^{n+2} -2d3^{n+1}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = -5d 3^{n+1}</mrow>
</md>
<p>
We want <m>f_0</m> to be a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation,
meaning that <m>(A+2)(A-6)f_0 = 3^n</m>. This implies that we need to
take <m>d=-1/15</m>. Now, as we mentioned earlier, the general solution
is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = f_0(n) + f_1(n) = -\frac{1}{15}3^n + c_1 (-2)^n + c_2
  6^n.
</me>
<p>
We leave it to you to verify that this does satisfy the given equation.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
You hopefully noticed that in the previous example, we said that the
first guess to try for a particular solution looks a lot like right
hand side of the equation, rather than exactly like. Our next example
will show why we can't always take something that matches exactly.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
Find the solution to the advancement operator equation
</p>
<me>
  (A+2)(A-6)f=6^n
</me>
<p>
if <m>f(0) = 1</m> and <m>f(1) = 5</m>.
</p>

<p>
The corresponding homogeneous equation here is the same as in the
previous example, so its general solution is again <m>f_1(n) =
  c_1(-2)^n + c_2 6^n</m>. Thus, the real work here is finding a
particular solution <m>f_0</m> to the given advancement operator
equation. Let's just try what our work on the previous example would
suggest here, namely <m>f_0(n) = d6^n</m>. Applying the advancement
operator polynomial <m>(A+2)(A-6)</m> to <m>f_0</m> then gives, uh, well,
zero, since <m>(A-6)(d6^n) = d6^{n+1}-6d6^n =0</m>. Huh, that didn't work
out so well. However, we can take a cue from how we tackled
homogeneous advancement operator equations with repeated roots and
introduce a factor of <m>n</m>. Let's try <m>f_0(n) = dn6^n</m>. Now we have
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A+2)(A-6)(dn6^n) \amp = (A+2)(d(n+1)6^{n+1}-6dn6^n)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = (A+2)d6^{n+1}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = d6^{n+2} + 2d 6^{n+1}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 6^n(36d+12d) = 48d6^n.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
We want this to be equal to <m>6^n</m>, so we have <m>d = 1/48</m>. Therefore,
the general solution is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = \frac{1}{48}n6^n + c_1 (-2)^n + c_2 6^n.
</me>
<p>
All that remains is to use our initial conditions to find the
constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. We have that they satisfy the following
pair of equations:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  1 \amp  = c_1 + c_2</mrow>
  <mrow>  5 \amp  = \frac{1}{8} -2c_1+6c_2</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Solving these, we arrive at the desired solution, which is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = \frac{1}{48}n6^n + \frac{9}{64} (-2)^n + \frac{55}{64} 6^n.
</me>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
What's the lesson we should take away from this example? When making a
guess at a particular solution of a nonhomogeneous advancement
operator equation, it does us no good to use any terms that are also
solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation, as they will be
annihilated by the advancement operator polynomial. Let's see how this
comes into play when finally resolving one of our longstanding examples.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex_recurrence_lines-solved">
<statement>
<p>
We're now ready to answer the question of how many regions are
determined by <m>n</m> lines in the plane in general position as we
discussed in <xref ref="s_recurrence_intro_lines" autoname="yes" />. We have the
recurrence equation
</p>
<me>
  r_{n+1} = r_n + n+1,
</me>
<p>
which yields the nonhomogeneous advancement operator equation
<m>(A-1)r = n+1</m>. As usual, we need to start with the general
solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation. This solution is
<m>f_1(n) = c_1</m>. Now our temptation is to try <m>f_0(n)=d_1n+d_2</m> as a
particular solution. However since the constant term there is a
solution to the homogeneous equation, we need a bit more. Let's try
increasing the powers of <m>n</m> by <m>1</m>, giving <m>f_0(n) = d_1n^2 +
  d_2n</m>. Now we have
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A-1)(d_1n^2+d_2n) \amp  = d_1(n+1)^2+d_2(n+1) - d_1n^2 -d_2n</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 2d_1n+d_1+d_2.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
This tells us that we need <m>d_1=1/2</m> and <m>d_2=1/2</m>, giving <m>f_0(n) =
  n^2/2 + n/2</m>. The general solution is then
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = c_1 + \frac{n^2+n}{2}.
</me>
<p>
What is our initial condition here? Well, one line divides the plane
into two regions, so <m>f(1) = 2</m>. On the other hand, <m>f(1) = c_1 +
  1</m>, so <m>c_1=1</m> and thus
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = 1 + \frac{n^2+n}{2} = \binom{n+1}{2} + 1
</me>
<p>
is the number of regions into which the plane is divided by <m>n</m>
lines in general position.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
We conclude this section with one more example showing how to deal
with a nonhomogeneous advancement operator equation in which the right
hand side is of <q>mixed type</q>.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
Give the general solution of the advancement operator equation
</p>
<me>
  (A-2)^2 f = 3^n + 2n.
</me>
<p>
Finding the solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation is
getting pretty easy at this point, so just note that
</p>
<me>
  f_1(n) = c_1 2^n + c_2 n2^n.
</me>
<p>
What should we try as a particular solution? Fortunately, we have no
interference from <m>p(A)=(A-2)^2</m> here. Our first instinct is
probably to try <m>f_0(n) = d_1 3^n + d_2 n</m>. However, this won't
actually work. (Try it. You wind up with a leftover constant term
that you can't just make zero.) The key here is that if we use a
term with a nonzero power of <m>n</m> in it, we need to include the lower
order powers as well (so long as they're not superfluous because of
<m>p(A)</m>). Thus, we try
</p>
<me>
  f_0(n) = d_1 3^n + d_2 n + d_3.
</me>
<p>
This gives
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  (A-2)^2(d_1 3^n + d_2 n + d_3) \amp  = (A-2)(d_13^{n+1} + d_2(n+1)+d_3
    - 2d_1 3^n - 2d_2 n -2d_3)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = (A-2)(d_13^n - d_2n + d_2 -d_3)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = d_1 3^{n+1} - d_2(n+1) + d_2 - d_3 - 2 d_1 3^n + 2d_2 n -2d_2
    + 2d_3</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = d_1 3^n + d_2 n -2d_2 + d_3.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
We want this to be <m>3^n+2n</m>, so matching coefficients gives <m>d_1 =
  1</m>, <m>d_2 =2</m>, and <m>d_3=4</m>. Thus, the general solution is
</p>
<me>
  f(n) = 3^n+2n+4 + c_1 2^n + c_2 n 2^n.
</me>
</statement>
