<div class="para">A school is preparing the schedule of classes for the next academic year. They are concerned about scheduling calculus, physics, English, statistics, economics, chemistry, and German classes, planning to offer a single section of each one. Below are the lists of courses that each of six students must take in order to successfully graduate.
