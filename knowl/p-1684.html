<div class="para">Because of the cyclic nature of the note names, we may consider arranging them in order clockwise around a circle. Selecting the notes for a scale then becomes a coloring problem if we say that selected notes are colored black and unselected notes are colored white. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_scales.html" title="Figure 15.12">FigureÂ 15.12</a>, we show three <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-note scales using this convention. Notice that since <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> can be obtained from <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> by rotating it forward seven positions, <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> are equivalent by the transposition of adding <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> is not equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{,}\)</span> as it cannot be obtained from them by rotation. (Note that <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> could be obtained from <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> if we allowed flips in addition to rotations. Since the only operation allowed is the transposition, which corresponds to rotation, they are inequivalent.)</div>
