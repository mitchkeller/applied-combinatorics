<div class="para">The list of applications of the Local Lemma has been growing steadily, as has the interest in how the lemma can be applied algorithmically, i.e., in a constructive setting. But here we present one of the early applications to Ramsey theory—estimating the Ramsey number <span class="process-math">\((R,3,n)\text{.}\)</span>  Recall that we have the basic inequality <span class="process-math">\(R(3,n)\le \binom{n+1}{3}\)</span> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_graphramsey.html" title="Theorem 11.2: Ramsey’s Theorem for Graphs">Theorem 11.2</a>, and it is natural to turn to the probabilistic method to look for good lower bounds.  But a few minutes thought shows that there are challenges to this approach.</div>
