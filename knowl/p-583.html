<div class="para">This result is usually referred to as Cayley’s Formula, although equivalent results were proven earlier by James J. Sylvester (1857) and Carl W. Borchardt (1860). The reason that Cayley’s name is most often affixed to this result is that he was the first to state and prove it in graph theoretic terminology (in 1889). (Although one could argue that Cayley really only proved it for <span class="process-math">\(n=6\)</span> and then claimed that it could easily be extended for all other values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and whether such an extension can actually happen is open to some debate.) Cayley’s Formula has many different proofs, most of which are quite elegant. If you’re interested in presentations of several proofs, we encourage you to read the chapter on Cayley’s Formula in <span class="booktitle">Proofs from THE BOOK</span> by Aigner, Ziegler, and Hofmann, which contains four different proofs, all using different proof techniques. Here we give a fifth proof, due to Prüfer and published in 1918. Interestingly, even though Prüfer’s proof came after much of the terminology of graph theory was established, he seemed unaware of it and worked in the context of permutations and his own terminology, even though his approach clearly includes the ideas of graph theory. We will use a recursive technique in order to find a bijection between the set of labeled trees on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices and a natural set of size <span class="process-math">\(n^{n-2}\text{,}\)</span> the set of strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n-2\)</span> where the symbols in the string come from <span class="process-math">\([n]\text{.}\)</span>
