<div class="para">At this point, it’s natural to ask where this is going. After all, we’re trying to count the number of <em class="emphasis">nonequivalent</em> colorings, and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_fixed-square.html" title="Figure 15.2">Figure 15.2</a> makes no effort to group colorings based on how a transformation changes one coloring to another. It turns out that there is a useful connection between counting the nonequivalent colorings and determining the number of colorings fixed by each transformation. To develop this connection, we first need to discuss the equivalence relation created by the action of the transformations of the square on the set <span class="process-math">\(\cgC\)</span> of all <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-colorings of the square. (Refer to <a href="s_background_equivalence.html" class="internal" title="Section B.13: Equivalence Relations">Section B.13</a> for a refresher on the definition of equivalence relation.) To do this, notice that applying a transformation to a square with colored vertices results in another square with colored vertices. For instance, applying the transformation <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> to a square colored as in <span class="process-math">\(C_{12}\)</span> results in a square colored as in <span class="process-math">\(C_{13}\text{.}\)</span> We say that the transformations of the square <dfn class="terminology">act</dfn> on the set <span class="process-math">\(\cgC\)</span> of colorings. We denote this action by adding a star to the transformation name. For instance, <span class="process-math">\(r_1^*(C_{12})=C_{13}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v^*(C_{10})=C_{11}\text{.}\)</span>
