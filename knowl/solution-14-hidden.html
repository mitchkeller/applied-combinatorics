Note that <span class="process-math">\(R_5\)</span> is a partial order on <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,d,e\}\text{.}\)</span> The relation <span class="process-math">\(R_6\)</span> is not antisymmetric, as it contains both <span class="process-math">\((b,e)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((e,b)\text{.}\)</span>
