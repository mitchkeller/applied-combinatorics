<div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> is a poset, it is common to write <span class="process-math">\(x\le y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y\ge x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> as substitutes for <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\in P\text{.}\)</span> Of course, the notations <span class="process-math">\(x\lt y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y&gt;x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> mean <span class="process-math">\(x\le y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\ne y\text{.}\)</span> When the poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> remains fixed throughout a discussion, we will sometimes abbreviate <span class="process-math">\(x\le y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> by just writing <span class="process-math">\(x\le y\text{,}\)</span> etc. When <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are distinct points from <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> we say <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">covered</dfn> by <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> when <span class="process-math">\(x\lt y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and there is no point <span class="process-math">\(z\in X\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(x\lt z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\lt y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> For example, in the poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_3=(X,R_3)\)</span> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_binaryrel.html" title="Example 6.3">Example 6.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is covered by <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> covers <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is not covered by <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(a\lt e\lt f\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(R_3\text{.}\)</span> We can then associate with the poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> a <dfn class="terminology">cover graph</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{G}\)</span> whose vertex set is the ground set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> an edge in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{G}\)</span> if and only if one of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> covers the other in <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\text{.}\)</span> Again, for the poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_3\)</span> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_binaryrel.html" title="Example 6.3">Example 6.3</a>, we show the cover graph on the left side of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_covergraphs.html" title="Figure 6.4">Figure 6.4</a>.
