<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">Strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is just to present a single point.  Now suppose that the theorem holds for some integer <span class="process-math">\(h\ge1\text{.}\)</span>  We show how strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_{h+1}\)</span> proceeds.</div> <div class="para">First Builder follows strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_h\)</span> to form a poset <span class="process-math">\(P_1\text{.}\)</span>  Then he follows it a second time for form a poset <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{,}\)</span> with all points of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> incomparable to all points in <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{.}\)</span>  Now we consider two cases. Suppose first that Assigner has used <span class="process-math">\(h+1\)</span> or more antichains on the set of maximal elements of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\cup P_2\text{.}\)</span> In this case, he follows strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_h\)</span> a third time to build a poset <span class="process-math">\(P_3\)</span> with all points of <span class="process-math">\(P_3\)</span> less than all maximal elements of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\cup P_2\)</span> and incomparable with all other points.</div> <div class="para">Clearly, the height of the resulting poset is at most <span class="process-math">\(h+1\text{.}\)</span>  Also, Assigner must use <span class="process-math">\(h+1+\binom{h+1}{2}=\binom{h+2}{2}\)</span> antichains in partitioning the poset and she has used <span class="process-math">\(h+1\)</span> on the set of maximal elements.</div> <div class="para">So it remains only to consider the case where Assigner has used a set <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> antichains on the maximal elements of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\text{,}\)</span> and she has used exactly the same <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> antichains for the maximal elements of <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{.}\)</span> Then Builder presents a new point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and declares it to be greater than all points of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and incomparable with all points of <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{.}\)</span> Assigner must put <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in some antichain which is not in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Builder then follows strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_h\)</span> a third time, but now all points of <span class="process-math">\(P_3\)</span> are less than <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the maximal elements of <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{.}\)</span> Again, Assigner has been forced to use <span class="process-math">\(h+1\)</span> different antichains on the maximal elements and <span class="process-math">\(\binom{h+2}{2}\)</span> antichains altogether.</div></article></body>
