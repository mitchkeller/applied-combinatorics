<div class="para">While the general subject of linear programming is far too broad for this course, we would be remiss if we didn’t point out that:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Linear programming problems are a <em class="emphasis">very</em> important class of optimization problems and they have many applications in engineering, science, and industrial settings.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There are relatively efficient algorithms for finding solutions to linear programming problems.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A linear programming problem posed with rational coefficients and constants has an optimal solution with rational values—if it has an optimal solution at all.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A linear programming problem posed with integer coefficients and constants need not have an optimal solution with integer values—even when it has an optimal solution with rational values.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A very important theme in operations research is to determine when a linear programming problem posed in integers has an optimal solution with integer values.  This is a subtle and often very difficult problem.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The problem of finding a maximum flow in a network is a special case of a linear programming problem.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A network flow problem in which all capacities are integers has a maximum flow in which the flow on every edge is an integer.  The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm guarantees this!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In general, linear programming algorithms are not used on networks.  Instead, special purpose algorithms, such as Ford-Fulkerson, have proven to be more efficient in practice.</div></li>
