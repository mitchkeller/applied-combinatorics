    <title>Inclusion-Exclusion</title>


    <introduction>
        <p>In this chapter, we study an enumeration technique known as Inclusion-Exclusion. In its simplest case, it is absolutely intuitive.  Its power rests in the fact that in many situations, we start with an exponentially large calculation and see it reduce to a manageable size. We focus on three applications that every student of combinatorics should know: (1)<nbsp />counting surjections, (2)<nbsp />derangements, and (3)<nbsp />the Euler <m>\phi</m>-function.
