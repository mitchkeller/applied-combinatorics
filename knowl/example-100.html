<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Consider the following game. Nancy rolls a single die. She wins if she rolls a six. If she rolls any other number, she then rolls again and again until the first time that one of the following two situations occurs: (1) she rolls a six, which now this results in a loss or (2) she rolls the same number as she got on her first roll, which results in a win. As an example, here are some sequences of rolls that this game might take:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((4,2,3,5,1,1,1,4)\text{.}\)</span>  Nancy wins!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((6)\text{.}\)</span>  Nancy wins!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((5,2, 3,2,1,6)\text{.}\)</span> Nancy loses. Ouch.</div></li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">So what is the probability that Nancy will win this game?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Nancy can win with a six on the first roll. That has probability <span class="process-math">\(1/6\text{.}\)</span>  Then she might win on round <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\ge2\text{.}\)</span> To accomplish this, she has a <span class="process-math">\(5/6\)</span> chance of rolling a number other than six on the first roll; a <span class="process-math">\(4/6\)</span> chance of rolling something that avoids a win/loss decision on each of the rolls, <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> and then a <span class="process-math">\(1/6\)</span> chance of rolling the matching number on round <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  So the probability of a win is given by:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{6}+\sum_{n\ge 2}\frac{5}{6}\left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^{n-2}\frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{12}.
\end{equation*}
