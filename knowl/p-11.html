<div class="para">At Georgia Tech, MATH 3012: Applied Combinatorics, is a junior-level course targeted primarily at students pursuing the B.S. in Computer Science. The purpose of the course is to give students a broad exposure to combinatorial mathematics, using applications to emphasize fundamental concepts and techniques. Applied Combinatorics is also required of students seeking the B.S. in Mathematics, and it is one of two discrete mathematics courses that computer engineering students may select to fulfill a breadth requirement. The course will also often contain a selection of other engineering and science majors who are interested in learning more mathematics. As a consequence, in a typical semester, some 250 Georgia Tech students are enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. Students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics at Georgia Tech have already completed the three semester calculus sequenceâ€”with many students bypassing one or more of the these courses on the basis of advanced placement scores. Also, the students will know some linear algebra and can at least have a reasonable discussion about vector spaces, bases and dimension.</div>
