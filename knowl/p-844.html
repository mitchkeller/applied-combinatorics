<div class="para">As our first example of the power of inclusion-exclusion, consider the following situation: A grandfather has <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> distinct lottery tickets and wants to distribute them to his four grandchildren so that each child gets at least one ticket. In how many ways can he make such a distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(23\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(47\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> will almost surely not pay out the same amount as one with the numbers <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(7\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(31\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(48\text{,}\)</span> so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you have already recognized that the fact that we’re dealing with lottery tickets and grandchildren isn’t so important here. Rather, the important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set (lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don’t simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild gets a ticket.</div>
