<div class="para">It has been traditional to cast the subject of derangements as a story, called the Hat Check problem. The story belongs to the period of time when men wore top hats. For a fancy ball, <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> men check their top hats with the Hat Check person before entering the ballroom floor. Later in the evening, the mischievous hat check person decides to return hats at random. What is the probability that all <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> men receive a hat other than their own? It turns out that the answer is very close to <span class="process-math">\(1/e\text{,}\)</span> as the following result shows.</div>
