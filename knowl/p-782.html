<div class="para">Over coffee, Bob said that he really liked this chapter. “This material was full of cases of very concrete procedures for doing useful things. I like that.” Yolanda offered a somewhat different perspective “On the other hand, this last procedure only seems to work with interval orders and we still don’t have a clue as to how to find the width of a poset in the general case. This might be very difficult—like the graph coloring problems discussed in the last chapter.” Dave weighed in with “Somehow I think there’s going to be a fairly efficient process that works for all posets.  We may not have all the tools yet, but let’s wait a bit.”</div>
