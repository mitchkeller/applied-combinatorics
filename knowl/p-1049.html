<div class="para">A businesswoman is traveling in Belgium and wants to buy chocolates for herself, her husband, and their two daughters. A store has dark chocolate truffles (€ 10/box), milk chocolate truffles (€ 8/box), nougat-filled chocolates (€ 5/box), milk chocolate bars (€ 7/bar), and 75% cacao chocolate bars (€ 11/bar). Her purchase is to be subject to the following:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Only the daughters like dark chocolate truffles, and her purchase must ensure that each daughter gets an equal number of boxes of them (if they get any).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">At least two boxes of milk chocolate truffles must be purchased.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If she buys any boxes of nougat-filled chocolates, then she buys exactly enough that each family member gets precisely one box of them.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">At most three milk chocolate bars may be purchased.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There are no restrictions on the number of 75% cacao chocolate bars.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(s_n\)</span> be the number of ways the businesswoman can spend exactly € <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (<em class="alert">not</em> buy <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items!) at this chocolate shop. Find the generating function for the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{s_n\colon n\geq 0\}\text{.}\)</span> In how many ways can she spend exactly € 100 at the chocolate shop? (A computer algebra system will be helpful for finding coefficients.)</div>
