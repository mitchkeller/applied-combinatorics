<div class="para">Now that we’ve identified the eight transformations of the square, let’s make a table showing which colorings from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_squares.html" title="Figure 15.1">Figure 15.1</a> are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{16}\)</span> remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let’s consider which colorings are fixed by <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> must be the same as the color at position <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> and the color at position <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> must be the same as the color at position <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> Thus, we would expect to find <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 2 = 4\)</span> colorings unchanged by <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> Examining <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_squares.html" title="Figure 15.1">Figure 15.1</a>, we see that these colorings are <span class="process-math">\(C_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C_6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C_8\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{16}\text{.}\)</span> Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_fixed-square.html" title="Figure 15.2">Figure 15.2</a>.</div>
