<div class="para">Hopefully the power of the cycle index to count colorings that are distinct when symmetries are considered is becoming apparent. In the next section, we will provide additional examples of how it can be used. However, we still haven’t seen the full power of Pólya’s technique. From the cycle index alone, we can determine how many colorings of the vertices of the square are distinct. However, what if we want to know how many of them have two white vertices and two gold vertices? This is where Pólya’s enumeration formula truly plays the role of a generating function.</div>
