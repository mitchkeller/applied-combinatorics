<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_olforest.html" title="Theorem 16.2">TheoremÂ 16.2</a> should be viewed as a negative result. It is hard to imagine a family of graphs easier to color than forests, yet in an on-line setting, graphs in this family are difficult to color. On the other hand, in certain settings, one can do reasonably well in an on-line setting, perhaps not as well as the true optimal off-line result but good enough to be useful. Here we present a particularly elegant example involving partially ordered sets.</div>
