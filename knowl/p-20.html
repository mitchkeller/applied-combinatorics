<div class="para">The main effort in producing this 2016 edition was to successfully convert to MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr>. Along the way, I attempted to correct all typographical errors we had noted in the past. There are undoubtedly more errors (typographical or otherwise) that will be corrected in future years, so please contact us via email if you spot any. The text now has an index, which may prove more helpful than searching PDF files when looking for the most essential locations of some common terms. Since MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr> makes it easy, we now also have a list of notation. Instructors will likely be glad to know that there were no changes to the exercises, so lists of assigned exercises from past years remain completely valid.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> The only significant changes to the body of the text was to convert <abbr class="initialism">WTT</abbr>’s code snippets from C to Python/SageMath. This has allowed us to embed interactive SageMath cells that readers who use the <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> version of the text can run and edit. We’ve only scratched the surface with this powerful feature of MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr>, so look for more SageMath additions in future years.</div>
