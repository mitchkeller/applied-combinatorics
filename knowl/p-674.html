<div class="para">More generally, when humans are asked to express preferences among a set of options, they often report that establishing a totally ranked list is difficult if not impossible. Instead, they prefer to report a partial order—where comparisons are made between certain pairs of options but not between others. In this chapter, we make these observations more concrete by introducing the concept of a partially ordered set. Elementary examples include (1) a family of sets which is partially ordered by inclusion and (2) a set of positive integers which is partially ordered by division. From an applications standpoint, a complex construction job typically involves a large number of projects for which there is a notion of precedence between some but not all pairs.  Also, computer file systems are modeled by trees which become partially ordered sets whenever links are added.</div>
