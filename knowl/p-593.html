<div class="para">With the knowledge of which labels belong to the leaves of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> in hand, we are ready to use induction to complete the proof. Our goal is to show that if given a string <span class="process-math">\(\bfs=s_1s_2\cdots s_{n-2}\)</span> whose symbols come from a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements, there is a unique tree <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\prufer(\bfT) = \bfs\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{,}\)</span> the only such string is the empty string, so <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> both label leaves and we can construct only <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_2\text{.}\)</span> Now suppose we have the result for some <span class="process-math">\(m\geq 2\text{,}\)</span> and we try to prove it for <span class="process-math">\(m+1\text{.}\)</span> We have a string <span class="process-math">\(\bfs = s_1s_2\cdots s_{m-1}\)</span> with symbols from <span class="process-math">\([m+1]\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> be the set of symbols appearing in <span class="process-math">\(\bfs\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be the least element of <span class="process-math">\([m+1]-I\text{.}\)</span> By the previous paragraph, we know that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the label of a leaf of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> and that its unique neighbor is the vertex labeled <span class="process-math">\(s_1\text{.}\)</span> The string <span class="process-math">\(\bfs'=s_2s_3\cdots s_{m-1}\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(m-2\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> does not appear in <span class="process-math">\(\bfs\text{,}\)</span> its symbols come from <span class="process-math">\(S=[m+1]-\{k\}\text{,}\)</span> which has size <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> Thus, by induction, there is a unique tree <span class="process-math">\(\bfT'\)</span> whose Pr√ºfer code is <span class="process-math">\(\bfs'\text{.}\)</span> We form <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\bfT'\)</span> by attaching a leaf with label <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> to the vertex of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT'\)</span> with label <span class="process-math">\(s_1\)</span> and have a tree of the desired type.</div>
