<div class="para">Why have we limited our attention to recurrence equations of the form <span class="process-math">\(p(A)f = g\)</span> where the constant term in <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is non-zero? Letâ€™s consider the alternative for a moment. Suppose that the constant term of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is zero and that <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> of multiplicity <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span>  Then <span class="process-math">\(p(A) = A^mq(A)\)</span> where the constant term of <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is non-zero. And the equation <span class="process-math">\(p(A)f=g\)</span> can then be written as <span class="process-math">\(A^mq(A)f=g\text{.}\)</span> To solve this equation, we consider instead the simpler problem <span class="process-math">\(q(A)f=g\text{.}\)</span>  Then <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is a solution of the original problem if and only if the function <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(h'(n) = h(n+m)\)</span> is a solution to the simpler problem. In other words, solutions to the original problem are just translations of solutions to the smaller one, so we will for the most part continue to focus on advancement operator equations where <span class="process-math">\(p(A)\)</span> has nonzero constant term, since being able to solve such problems is all we need in order to solve the larger class of problems.</div>
