<title>Another look at distributing apples or folders</title>
<p>
A recurring problem so far in this book has been to consider problems
that ask about distributing indistinguishable objects (say apples) to
distinct entities (say children). We started in <xref ref="ch_strings" autoname="yes" />
by asking how many ways there were to distribute <m>40</m> apples to <m>5</m>
children so that each child is guaranteed to get at least one apple
and saw that the answer was <m>C(39,4)</m>. We even saw how to restrict the
situation so that one of the children was limited and could receive at
most <m>10</m> apples. In <xref ref="ch_inclusion-exclusion" autoname="yes" />, we learned how
to extend the restrictions so that more than one child had
restrictions on the number of apples allowed by taking advantage of
the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Before moving on to see how
generating functions can allow us to get even more creative with our
restrictions, let's take a moment to see how generating functions
would allow us to solve the most basic problem at hand.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
We already know that the number of ways to distribute <m>n</m> apples to
<m>5</m> children so that each child gets at least one apple is
<m>C(n-1,4)</m>, but it will be instructive to see how we can derive this
result using generating functions. Let's start with an even simpler
problem: how many ways are there to distribute <m>n</m> apples to
<em>one</em> child so that each child receives at least one apple?
Well, this isn't too hard, there's only one way to do it<mdash />give all
the apples to the lucky kid! Thus the <em>sequence</em> that
enumerates the number of ways to do this is <m>\{a_n\colon n\geq 1\}</m>
with <m>a_n=1</m> for all <m>n\geq 1</m>. Then the generating function for
this sequence is
</p>
<me>
  x+x^2+x^3+\cdots = x(1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots) = \frac{x}{1-x}.
</me>
<p>
How can we get from this fact to the question of five children?
Notice what happens when we multiply
</p>
<me>
  (x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)
  (x+x^2+\cdots).
</me>
<p>
To see what this product represents, first
consider how many ways can we get an <m>x^6</m>? We could use the <m>x^2</m>
from the first factor and <m>x</m> from each of the other four, or <m>x^2</m>
from the second factor and <m>x</m> from each of the other four, etc.,
meaning that the coefficient on <m>x^6</m> is <m>5 = C(5,4)</m>. More
generally, what's the coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in the product? In the
expansion, we get an <m>x^n</m> for every product of the form
<m>x^{k_1}x^{k_2}x^{k_3}x^{k_4}x^{k_5}</m> where <m>k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4+k_5 =
  n</m>. Returning to the general question here, we're really dealing
with distributing <m>n</m> apples to <m>5</m> children, and since <m>k_i> 0</m> for
<m>i=1,2,\dots,5</m>, we also have the guarantee that each child receives
at least one apple, so the product of the generating function for
<em>one</em> child gives the generating function for <em>five</em>
children.
</p>

<p>
Let's pretend for a minute that we didn't know that the coefficients
must be <m>C(n-1,4)</m>. How could we figure out the coefficients just
from the generating function? The generating function we're
interested in is <m>x^5/(1-x)^5</m>, which you should be able to pretty
quickly see satisfies
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  \frac{x^5}{(1-x)^5} \amp =
  \frac{x^5}{4!}\frac{d^4}{dx^4}\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) =
  \frac{x^5}{4!}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)x^{n-4}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{4!}x^{n+1} =
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{n}{4}x^{n+1}.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
The coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in this series <m>C(n-1,4)</m>, just as we expected.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
We could revisit an example from <xref ref="ch_inclusion-exclusion" autoname="yes" /> to
see that if we wanted to limit a child to receive at most <m>4</m> apples,
we would use <m>(x+x^2+x^3+x^4)</m> as its generating function instead of
<m>x/(1-x)</m>, but rather than belabor that here, let's try something a
bit more exotic.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
A grocery store is preparing holiday fruit baskets for sale. Each
fruit basket will have <m>20</m> pieces of fruit in it, chosen from
apples, pears, oranges, and grapefruit. How many different ways can
such a basket be prepared if there must be at least one apple in a
basket, a basket cannot contain more than three pears, and the
number of oranges must be a multiple of four?
</p>

<p>
In order to get at the number of baskets consisting of <m>20</m> pieces
of fruit, let's solve the more general problem where each basket has
<m>n</m> pieces of fruit. Our method is simple: find the generating
function for how to do this with each type of fruit individually and
then multiply them. As in the previous example, the product will
contain the term <m>x^n</m> for every way of assembling a basket of <m>n</m>
pieces of fruit subject to our restrictions. The apple generating
function is <m>x/(1-x)</m>, since we only want positive powers of <m>x</m>
(corresponding to ensuring at least one apple). The generating
function for pears is <m>(1+x+x^2+x^3)</m>, since we can have only zero,
one, two, or three pears in basket. For oranges we have <m>1/(1-x^4) =
  1+x^4+x^8+\cdots</m>, and the unrestricted grapefruit give us a factor
of <m>1/(1-x)</m>. Multiplying, we have
</p>
<me>
  \frac{x}{1-x} (1+x+x^2+x^3) \frac{1}{1-x^4} \frac{1}{1-x} =
  \frac{x}{(1-x)^2(1-x^4)} (1+x+x^2+x^3).
</me>
<p>
Now we want to make use of
the fact that <m>(1+x+x^2+x^3) =(1-x^4)/(1-x)</m> to see that our
generating function is
</p>
<me>
  \frac{x}{(1-x)^3} = \frac{x}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)x^{n-2} =
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n(n-1)}{2} x^{n-1} =
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{n}{2} x^{n-1} =
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{n+1}{2} x^n.
</me>
<p>
Thus, there are <m>C(n+1,2)</m> possible fruit baskets containing <m>n</m>
pieces of fruit, meaning that the answer to the question we
originally asked is <m>C(21,2) = 210</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Find the number of integer solutions to the equation
</p>
<me>
  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = n
</me>
<p>
(<m>n\geq 0</m> an integer) with <m>x_1 \geq 0</m>
even, <m>x_2\geq 0</m>, and <m>0\leq x_3\leq 2</m>.
</p>

<p>
Again, we want to look at the generating function we would have if
each variable existed individually and take their product. For
<m>x_1</m>, we get a factor of <m>1/(1-x^2)</m>; for <m>x_2</m>, we have <m>1/(1-x)</m>;
and for <m>x_3</m> our factor is <m>(1+x+x^2)</m>. Therefore, the generating
function for the number of solutions to the equation above is
</p>
<me>
  \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1-x)(1-x^2)} = \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1+x)(1-x)^2}.
</me>
<p>
In calculus, when we wanted to integrate a rational function of this
form, we would use the method of partial fractions to write it as a
sum of <q>simpler</q> rational functions whose antiderivatives we
recognized. Here, our technique is the same, as we can readily
recognize the formal power series for many rational functions. Our
goal is to write
</p>
<me>
  \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1+x)(1-x)^2} = \frac{A}{1+x} + \frac{B}{1-x} +
  \frac{C}{(1-x)^2}
</me>
<p>
for appropriate constants, <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>. To find the constants,
we clear the denominators, giving
</p>
<me>
  1+x+x^2 = A(1-x)^2 + B(1-x^2) + C(1+x).
</me>
<p>
Equating coefficients on terms of equal degree, we have:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  1 \amp = A+B+C</mrow>
  <mrow>  1 \amp = -2A + C</mrow>
  <mrow>  1 \amp = A - B</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Solving the system, we find <m>A=1/4</m>, <m>B=-3/4</m>, and
<m>C=3/2</m>. Therefore, our generating function is
</p>
<me>
  \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{1+x} -\frac{3}{4} \frac{1}{1-x} +\frac{3}{2}
  \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^n -
  \frac{3}{4} \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n + \frac{3}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n
  x^{n-1}.
</me>
<p>
The solution to our question is thus the coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in the
above generating function, which is
</p>
<me>
  \frac{(-1)^n}{4} - \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3(n+1)}{2},
</me>
<p>
a surprising answer that would not be too easy to come up with via
other methods!
