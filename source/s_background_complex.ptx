    <title>Obtaining the Complex Numbers from the Reals</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>By now, the following discussion should be transparent.  The <term>complex number system</term><idx><h>complex number</h><h>formal definition of</h></idx> <m>\complexes</m> is just the cartesian product <m>\reals\times\reals</m> with
                  <ol>
            <li><p><m>(a,b) = (c,d)</m> in <m>\complexes</m> if and only if <m>a=c</m> and <m>b=d</m> in <m>\reals</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p><m>(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p><m>(a,b)(c,d)=(ac-bd, ad+bc)</m>.</p></li>
        
                  </ol>
                </p>

        <p>Now the complex numbers of the form <m>(a,0)</m> behave just like real numbers, so is natural to say that the complex number system <term>contains</term> the real number system. Also, note that <m>(0,1)^2=(0,1)(0,1)=(-1,0)</m>, <ie />, the complex number <m>(0,1)</m> has the property that its square is the complex number behaving like the real number<nbsp /><m>-1</m>. So it is convenient to use a special symbol like <m>i</m> for this very special complex number and note that <m>i^2=-1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>With this beginning, it is straightforward to develop all the familiar properties of the complex number system.

        <title>Decimal Representation of Real Numbers</title>
        <p>Every real number has a decimal expansion<mdash />although the number of digits after the decimal point may be infinite.  A rational number <m>q=m/m</m> from <m>\rats</m> has an expansion in which a certain block of digits repeats indefinitely.  For example,
        <me>
            \frac{2859}{35} = 81.6857142857142857142857142857142857142857142\dots
        </me>
        In this case, the block <m>857142</m> of size<nbsp /><m>6</m> is repeated forever.
        </p>

        <p>Certain rational numbers have <term>terminating decimal expansions</term>.  For example, we know that <m>385/8= 48.125</m>. If we chose to do so, we could write this instead as an infinite decimal by appending trailing <m>0</m>'s, as a repeating block of size<nbsp /><m>1</m>:
        <me>
            \frac{385}{8} = 48.1250000000000000000000000000000000\dots
        </me>
        On the other hand, we can also write the decimal expansion of <m>385/8</m> as
        <me>
            \frac{385}{8} = 48.12499999999999999999999999999999999\dots
        </me>
        Here, we intend that the digit <m>9</m>, a block of size<nbsp /><m>1</m>, be repeated forever.  Apart from this anomaly, the decimal expansion of real numbers is unique.
        </p>

        <p>On the other hand, irrational numbers have non-repeating decimal expansions in which there is no block of repeating digits that repeats forever.
        </p>

        <p>You know that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. Here is the first part of its decimal expansion:
        <me>
            \sqrt{2} =1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537694807317667973\dots
        </me>
        An irrational number is said to be <term>algebraic</term> if it is the root of polynomial with integer coefficients; else it is said to be <term>transcendental</term>.  For example, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is algebraic since it is the root of the polynomial <m>x^2-2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>Two other famous examples of irrational numbers are <m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m>.  Here are their decimal expansions:
        <md>
            <mrow>\pi \amp =3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459\dots</mrow>
            <intertext>and</intertext>
            <mrow> e\amp=2.7182818284590452353602874713526624977572470936999595749669676277\dots</mrow>
        </md>
        Both <m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m> are transcendental.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>Amanda and Bilal, both students at a nearby university, have been studying rational numbers that have large blocks of repeating digits in their decimal expansions.  Amanda reports that she has found two positive integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> with <m>n\lt 500</m> for which the decimal expansion of the rational number <m>m/n</m> has a block of 1961 digits which repeats indefinitely. Not to be outdone, Bilal brags that he has found such a pair <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> of positive integers with <m>t\lt 300</m> for which the decimal expansion of <m>s/t</m> has a block of <m>7643</m> digits which repeats indefinitely. Bilal should be (politely) told to do his arithmetic more carefully, as there is no such pair of positive integers (<em>Why</em>?). On the other hand, Amanda may in fact be correct<mdash />although, if she has done her work with more attention to detail, she would have reported that the decimal expansion of <m>m/n</m> has a smaller block of repeating digits (<em>Why</em>?).
            </p>

        <proposition>
            <statement>
                <p>There is no surjection from <m>\posints</m> to the set <m>X= \{x\in\reals:0\lt x\lt 1\}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
                <p>Let <m>f</m> be a function from <m>\posints</m> to <m>X</m>.  For each <m>n\in \posints</m>, consider the decimal expansion(s) of the real number <m>f(n)</m>. Then choose a positive integer <m>a_n</m> so that (1)<nbsp /><m>a_n\le 8</m>, and (2)<nbsp /><m>a_n</m> is not the <m>n^{th}</m> digit after the decimal point in any decimal expansion of <m>f(n)</m>.  Then the real number <m>x</m> whose decimal expansion is <m>x=.a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\dots</m> is an element of <m>X</m> which is distinct from <m>f(n)</m>, for every <m>n\in\posints</m>.  This shows that <m>f</m> is not a surjection.
                </p>
