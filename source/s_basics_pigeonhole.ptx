    <title>The Pigeon Hole Principle</title>
    <p>A function <m>f:X\longrightarrow Y</m> is said to be <m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m> (read <term>one-to-one</term><idx><h>function</h><h>one-to-one</h></idx>) when <m>f(x)\neq f(x')</m> for all <m>x,x'\in X</m> with <m>x\neq x'</m>. A <m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m> function is also called an <term>injection</term> or we say that <m>f</m> is <term>injective</term><idx><h>function</h><h>injective</h></idx><idx><h>injection</h></idx>. When <m>f:X\longrightarrow Y</m> is <m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m>, we note that <m>|X|\le |Y|</m>.  Conversely, we have the following self-evident statement, which is popularly called the <q>Pigeon Hole</q> principle.

    <proposition xml:id="prop_pigeon">
        <title>Pigeon Hole Principle</title>
        <idx><h>pigeon hole principle</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>If <m>f:X\longrightarrow Y</m> is a function and <m>|X|>|Y|</m>, then there exists an element <m>y\in Y</m> and distinct elements <m>x,x'\in X</m> so that <m>f(x)=f(x')=y</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>In more casual language, if you must put <m>n+1</m> pigeons into <m>n</m> holes, then you must put two pigeons into the same hole.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a classic result, whose proof follows immediately from the <xref ref="prop_pigeon" text="title" />.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_ErdosSzekeres">
        <title>Erd&#337;s/Szekeres Theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>If <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are non-negative integers, then any sequence of <m>mn+1</m> distinct real numbers either has an increasing subsequence of <m>m+1</m> terms, or it has a decreasing subsequence of <m>n+1</m> terms.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
            <p>Let <m>\sigma=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_{mn+1})</m> be a sequence of <m>mn+1</m> distinct real numbers. For each <m>i=1,2,\dots,mn+1</m>, let <m>a_i</m> be the maximum number of terms in a increasing subsequence of <m>\sigma</m> with <m>x_i</m> the first term. Also, let <m>b_i</m> be the maximum number of terms in a decreasing subsequence of <m>\sigma</m> with <m>x_i</m> the last term. If there is some <m>i</m> for which <m>a_i\ge m+1</m>, then <m>\sigma</m> has an increasing subsequence of <m>m+1</m> terms. Conversely, if for some <m>i</m>, we have <m>b_i\ge n+1</m>, then we conclude that <m>\sigma</m> has a decreasing subsequence of <m>n+1</m> terms.
            </p>

            <p>It remains to consider the case where <m>a_i\le m</m> and <m>b_i\le n</m> for all <m>i=1,2,\dots,mn+1</m>. Since there are <m>mn</m> ordered pairs of the form <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>1\le a\le m</m> and <m>1\le b\le n</m>, we conclude from the Pigeon Hole principle that there must be integers <m>i_1</m> and <m>i_2</m> with <m>1\le i_1\lt i_2\le mn+1</m> for which <m>(a_{i_1},b_{i_1})=(a_{i_2},b_{i_2})</m>.  Since <m>x_{i_1}</m> and <m>x_{i_2}</m> are distinct, we either have <m>x_{i_1}\lt x_{i_2}</m> or <m>x_{i_1}>x_{i_2}</m>. In the first case, any increasing subsequence with <m>x_{i_2}</m> as its first term can be extended by prepending <m>x_{i_1}</m> at the start. This shows that <m>a_{i_1}>a_{i_2}</m>.  In the second case, any decreasing sequence of with <m>x_{i_1}</m> as its last element can be extended by adding <m>x_{i_2}</m> at the very end. This shows <m>b_{i_2}>b_{i_1}</m>.
            </p>
        </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>In <xref ref="ch_probmeth"  />, we will explore some powerful generalizations of the <xref ref="prop_pigeon" text="title" />. All these results have the flavor of the general assertion that total disarray is impossible.
