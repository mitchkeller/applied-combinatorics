<div class="para">Because I (<abbr class="initialism">MTK</abbr>) didn’t have the chance to teach from this book during the 2016–2017 academic year, there were few opportunities to examine some of the areas where improvements are due in the text. That said, some changes suggested in the <a href="preface-2016.html" class="internal" title="Preface: Preface to 2016 Edition">Preface to 2016 Edition</a> did come to fruition in this edition. In particular, the numbering of many things in <a href="ch_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Generating Functions">Chapter 8</a> will not match the 2016 Edition in a number of places because of the addition of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_genfunction_multisets.html" title="Example 8.7">Example 8.7</a> to address the coefficients on <span class="process-math">\(1/(1-x)^n\)</span> in a way that doesn’t require calculus. There is also one new exercise in <a href="ch_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Generating Functions">Chapter 8</a>, which has been placed at the end to retain consistency of numbering. Other than correcting errors, there have been no changes to the exercises, so faculty members teaching from the text may continue to assign the same exercise numbers with confidence that they are the same exercises they have been in the past.</div>
