    <title>Obtaining the Reals from the Rationals</title>
    <p>A full discussion of this would take us far away from a discrete math class, but let's at least provide the basic definitions. A subset <m>S\subset \rats</m> of the rationals is called a <term>cut</term><idx><h>cut</h><h>Dedekind</h></idx> (also, a <term>Dedekind cut</term>), if it satisfies the following properties:
                  <ol>
        <li><p><m>\emptyset\neq S\neq \rats</m>, i.e, <m>S</m> is a proper non-empty subset of <m>\rats</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p><m>x\in S</m> and <m>y\lt x</m> in <m>\rats</m> implies <m>y\in S</m>, for all <m>x,y\in \rats</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>For every <m>x\in S</m>, there exists <m>y\in S</m> with <m>x\lt y</m>, <ie />, <m>S</m> has no greatest element.</p></li>
    
                  </ol>
                </p>

    <p>Cuts are also called <term>real numbers</term><idx><h>real number</h><h>formal definition of</h></idx>, so a real number is a particular kind of set of rational numbers.  For every rational number <m>q</m>, the set <m>\bar{q}= \{p\in \rats: p\lt q\}</m> is a cut. Such cuts are called <term>rational cuts</term>. Inside the reals, the rational cuts behave just like the rational numbers and via the map <m>h(q)=\bar{q}</m>, we abuse notation again (we are getting used to this) and say that the rational numbers are a subset of the real numbers.
    </p>

    <p>But there are cuts which are not rational. Here is one: <m>\{p\in \rats: p\le 0\}\cup \{p\in \rats: p^2\lt 2\}</m>. The fact that this cut is not rational depends on the familiar proof that there is no rational <m>q</m> for which <m>q^2=2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>The operation of addition on cuts is defined in the natural way. If <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are cuts, set <m>S+T=\{s+t:s\in S, t\in T\}</m>.  Order on cuts is defined in terms of inclusion, <ie />, <m>S\lt T</m> if and only if <m>S\subsetneq T</m>. A cut is <term>positive</term> if it is greater than <m>\bar{0}</m>. When <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are positive cuts, the product <m>ST</m> is defined by
    <me>
        ST= \bar{0}\cup\{st:s\in S, t\in T, s\ge0, t\ge 0\}.
    </me>
    One can easily show that there is a real number <m>r</m> so that <m>r^2=\bar{2}</m>. You may be surprised, but perhaps not, to learn that this real number is denoted <m>\sqrt2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>There are many other wonders to this story, but enough for one day.
