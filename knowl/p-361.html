<div class="para">Before looking at a refined version of this proof, let’s take a moment to discuss the key steps in every proof by induction. The first step is the <dfn class="terminology">basis step</dfn>, in which the open statement <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is shown to be true. (It’s worth noting that there’s nothing special about <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> here. If we want to prove only that <span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span> is true for all integers <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 5\text{,}\)</span> then proving that <span class="process-math">\(S_5\)</span> is true is our basis step.) When proving the basis step, if <span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span> is an equation, we do not just write down <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and move on. We need to <em class="emphasis">prove</em> that <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is true. Notice how in the proof above, we discussed the left-hand side of <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and the right-hand side of <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and concluded that they were equal.</div>
