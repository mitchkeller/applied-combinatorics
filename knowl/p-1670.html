<div class="para">Unlike the generating functions we encountered in <a href="ch_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Generating Functions">Chapter 8</a>, the generating functions we will develop in this chapter will have more than one variable. We begin by associating a monomial with each element of the permutation group involved. In this case, it is <span class="process-math">\(D_8\text{,}\)</span> the dihedral group of the square. To determine the monomial associated to a permutation, we need to write the permutation in cycle notation and then determine the monomial based on the number of cycles of each length. Specifically, if <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is a permutation of <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(j_k\)</span> cycles of length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(1\leq k\leq n\text{,}\)</span> then the monomial associated to <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x_1^{j_1}x_2^{j_2}\cdots x_n^{j_n}\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(j_1 + 2j_2 + 3j_3 + \cdots + nj_n = n\text{.}\)</span> For example, the permutation <span class="process-math">\(r_1=(1234)\)</span> is associated with the monomial <span class="process-math">\(x_4^1\)</span> since it consists of a single cycle of length <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> The permutation <span class="process-math">\(r_2=(13)(24)\)</span> has two cycles of length <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> and thus its monomial is <span class="process-math">\(x_2^2\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(p=(14)(2)(3)\text{,}\)</span> we have two <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles and one <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle, yielding the monomial <span class="process-math">\(x_1^2x_2^1\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_square-cycles.html" title="Figure 15.10">Figure 15.10</a>, we show all eight permutations in <span class="process-math">\(D_8\)</span> along with their associated monomials.</div>
