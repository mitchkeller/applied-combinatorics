<div class="para">Xing was intrigued by the fact that he now had two fundamentally different ways to calculate binomial coefficients. One way is to write <span class="process-math">\(\binom{n}{m}=P(n,m)/(n-m)!\)</span> and just carry out the specified arithmetic. The second way is to use the recursion of Pascalâ€™s triangle, so that you are just performing additions. So he experimented by writing a computer program to calculate binomial coefficients, using a library that treats big integers as strings. Which of the two ways do you think proved to be faster when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> say was between <span class="process-math">\(1800\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> was around <span class="process-math">\(800\text{?}\)</span>
