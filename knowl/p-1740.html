<div class="para">Recall that a poset <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> of height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> can be partitioned into <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> antichainsâ€”by recursively removing the set of minimal elements.  But how many antichains are required in an on-line setting?  Now Builder constructs a poset <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> one point at a time, while Assigner constructs a partition of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> into antichains.  At each round, Builder will present a new point <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and list those points presented earlier that are, respectively, less than <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> greater than <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and incomparable with <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Subsequently, Assigner will assign <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to an antichain. This will be done either by adding <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to an antichain already containing one or more of the points presented previously, or by assigning <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to a new antichain.</div>
