<div class="para">To this point, it looks like maybe there’s a pattern forming. Perhaps it is the case that for all <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T_n = n^{n-2}\text{.}\)</span> This is in fact the case, but let’s see how it works out for <span class="process-math">\(n=5\)</span> before proving the result in general. What are the nonisomorphic trees on five vertices? Well, there’s <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{1,4}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_5\)</span> for sure, and there’s also the third tree shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_trees-5verts.html" title="Figure 5.38">Figure 5.38</a>. After thinking for a minute or two, you should be able to convince yourself that this is all of the possibilities. How many labelings by <span class="process-math">\([5]\)</span> does each of these have? There are <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{1,4}\)</span> since there are <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> ways to choose the vertex of degree <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_5\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> ways to choose the middle vertex of the path, <span class="process-math">\(C(4,2)=6\)</span> ways to label the two remaining vertices of degree <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> once the middle vertex is labeled, and then <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ways to label the vertices of degree <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> This gives <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> labelings. For the last tree, there are <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> ways to label the vertex of degree <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C(4,2)=6\)</span> ways to label the two leaves adjacent to the vertex of degree <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ways to label the remaining two vertices, giving <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> labelings. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(T_5=125=5^3=5^{5-2}\text{.}\)</span>
