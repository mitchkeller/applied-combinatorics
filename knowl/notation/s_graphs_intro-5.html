<div class="para">As is often the case in science and mathematics, different authors use slightly different notation and terminology for graphs. As an example, some use <dfn class="terminology">nodes</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">arcs</dfn> rather than vertices and edges. Others refer to vertices as <dfn class="terminology">points</dfn> and in this case, they often refer to <dfn class="terminology">lines</dfn> rather than edges. We will try to stick to vertices and edges but confess that we may occasionally lapse into referring to vertices as points. Also, following the patterns of many others, we will also say that adjacent vertices are <dfn class="terminology">neighbors</dfn>. And we will use the more or less standard terminology that the <dfn class="terminology">neighborhood</dfn> of a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the set of vertices adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Thus, using the graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> we have depicted in <a href="s_graphs_intro.html#fig_small_graph" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig_small_graph.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 5.1">FigureÂ 5.1</a>, vertices <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> are neighbors, and the neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\{a,c\}\)</span> while the neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> is the empty set. Also, the <dfn class="terminology">degree</dfn> of a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> in a graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> denoted <span class="process-math">\(\deg_\bfG(v)\text{,}\)</span> is then the number of vertices in its neighborhood, or equivalently, the number of edges incident to it. For example, we have <span class="process-math">\(\deg_\bfG(d)=\deg_\bfG(a)=2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\deg_\bfG(c)=\deg_\bfG(b)=1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\deg_\bfG(e)=0\text{.}\)</span> If the graph being discussed is clear from context, it is not uncommon to omit the subscript and simply write <span class="process-math">\(\deg(v)\)</span> for the degree of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span><div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#s_graphs_intro-5" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
