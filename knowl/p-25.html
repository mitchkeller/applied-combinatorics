<div class="para">We have some ideas for what might be updated for the 2017 Edition (e.g., <a href="ch_basics.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Combinatorial Basics">Chapter 4</a> needs to be expanded both in the body and the exercises, <a href="ch_genfunction.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Generating Functions">Chapter 8</a> would benefit from integration of SageMath to assist with generating function computations, and <a href="ch_kitchensink.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 16: The Many Faces of Combinatorics">Chapter 16</a> is still not really finished). However, we would love to hear from those of you who are using the text, too. Are there additional topics you’d like to see added? Chapters in need of more exercises? Topics whose exposition could be improved? Please reach out to us via email, and we’ll consider your suggestions.</div>
