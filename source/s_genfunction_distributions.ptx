  <title>Another look at distributing apples or folders</title>
  <p>A recurring problem so far in this book has been to consider problems that ask about
    distributing indistinguishable objects (say apples) to distinct entities (say children). We
    started in <xref ref="ch_strings" /> by asking how many ways there were to distribute <m>40</m>
    apples to <m>5</m> children so that each child is guaranteed to get at least one apple and saw
    that the answer was <m>C(39,4)</m>. We even saw how to restrict the situation so that one of the
    children was limited and could receive at most <m>10</m> apples. In <xref
      ref="ch_inclusion-exclusion" />, we learned how to extend the restrictions so that more than
    one child had restrictions on the number of apples allowed by taking advantage of the <xref
      ref="thm_inclusion-exclusion" text="title" />. Before moving on to see how generating
    functions can allow us to get even more creative with our restrictions, let's take a moment to
    see how generating functions would allow us to solve the most basic problem at hand. </p>
  <example xml:id="exa_genfunction_apples">
    <p>We already know that the number of ways to distribute <m>n</m> apples to <m>5</m> children so
      that each child gets at least one apple is <m>C(n-1,4)</m>, but it will be instructive to see
      how we can derive this result using generating functions. Let's start with an even simpler
      problem: how many ways are there to distribute <m>n</m> apples to <em>one</em> child so that
      each child receives at least one apple? Well, this isn't too hard, there's only one way to do
      it<mdash />give all the apples to the lucky kid! Thus the <em>sequence</em> that enumerates
      the number of ways to do this is <m>\{a_n\colon n\geq 1\}</m> with <m>a_n=1</m> for all <m>n\geq
      1</m>. Then the generating function for this sequence is <me>
        x+x^2+x^3+\cdots = x(1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots) = \frac{x}{1-x}.
      </me> How can
      we get from this fact to the question of five children? Notice what happens when we multiply <me>
      (x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)(x+x^2+\cdots)
        (x+x^2+\cdots).
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>To see what this product represents, first consider how many ways can we get an <m>x^6</m>?
      We could use the <m>x^2</m> from the first factor and <m>x</m> from each of the other four, or <m>
      x^2</m> from the second factor and <m>x</m> from each of the other four, <etc />, meaning that
      the coefficient on <m>x^6</m> is <m>5 = C(5,4)</m>. More generally, what's the coefficient on <m>
      x^n</m> in the product? In the expansion, we get an <m>x^n</m> for every product of the form <m>
      x^{k_1}x^{k_2}x^{k_3}x^{k_4}x^{k_5}</m> where <m>k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4+k_5 = n</m>. Returning to the
      general question here, we're really dealing with distributing <m>n</m> apples to <m>5</m>
      children, and since <m>k_i> 0</m> for <m>i=1,2,\dots,5</m>, we also have the guarantee that
      each child receives at least one apple, so the product of the generating function for <em>one</em>
      child gives the generating function for <em>five</em> children. </p>
    <p>Let's pretend for a minute that we didn't know that the coefficients must be <m>C(n-1,4)</m>.
      How could we figure out the coefficients just from the generating function? The generating
      function we're interested in is <m>x^5/(1-x)^5</m>, which you should be able to pretty quickly
      see satisfies <md>
        <mrow> \frac{x^5}{(1-x)^5} \amp =
          \frac{x^5}{4!}\frac{d^4}{dx^4}\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) =
          \frac{x^5}{4!}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)x^{n-4}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{4!}x^{n+1} =
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{n}{4}x^{n+1}.</mrow>
      </md> The coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in
      this series <m>C(n-1,4)</m>, just as we expected. </p>
  </example>

  <p>We could revisit an example from <xref ref="ch_inclusion-exclusion" /> to see that if we wanted
    to limit a child to receive at most <m>4</m> apples, we would use <m>(x+x^2+x^3+x^4)</m> as its
    generating function instead of <m>x/(1-x)</m>, but rather than belabor that here, let's try
    something a bit more exotic. </p>
  <example xml:id="exa_genfunction_fruit">
    <statement>
      <p>A grocery store is preparing holiday fruit baskets for sale. Each fruit basket will have <m>
        20</m> pieces of fruit in it, chosen from apples, pears, oranges, and grapefruit. How many
        different ways can such a basket be prepared if there must be at least one apple in a
        basket, a basket cannot contain more than three pears, and the number of oranges must be a
        multiple of four? </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>In order to get at the number of baskets consisting of <m>20</m> pieces of fruit, let's
        solve the more general problem where each basket has <m>n</m> pieces of fruit. Our method is
        simple: find the generating function for how to do this with each type of fruit individually
        and then multiply them. As in the previous example, the product will contain the term <m>x^n</m>
        for every way of assembling a basket of <m>n</m> pieces of fruit subject to our
        restrictions. The apple generating function is <m>x/(1-x)</m>, since we only want positive
        powers of <m>x</m> (corresponding to ensuring at least one apple). The generating function
        for pears is <m>(1+x+x^2+x^3)</m>, since we can have only zero, one, two, or three pears in
        basket. For oranges we have <m>1/(1-x^4) = 1+x^4+x^8+\cdots</m>, and the unrestricted
        grapefruit give us a factor of <m>1/(1-x)</m>. Multiplying, we have <me>
          \frac{x}{1-x} (1+x+x^2+x^3) \frac{1}{1-x^4} \frac{1}{1-x} =
          \frac{x}{(1-x)^2(1-x^4)} (1+x+x^2+x^3).
        </me>
        Now we want to make use of the fact that <m>(1+x+x^2+x^3) =(1-x^4)/(1-x)</m> (by <xref
          ref="eq_genfunction_finite-geom" />) to see that our generating function is <md>
          <mrow>\frac{x}{(1-x)^3} \amp= \frac{x}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)x^{n-2} =
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n(n-1)}{2} x^{n-1} </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{n}{2} x^{n-1} =
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{n+1}{2} x^n.</mrow>
        </md> Thus, there are <m>C(n+1,2)</m>
        possible fruit baskets containing <m>n</m> pieces of fruit, meaning that the answer to the
        question we originally asked is <m>C(21,2) = 210</m>. </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>The compact form of the solution to <xref ref="exa_genfunction_fruit" /> suggests that perhaps
    there is a way to come up with this answer without the use of generating functions. Thinking
    about such an approach would be a good way to solidify your understanding of a variety of the
    enumerative topics we have already covered.</p>
  <example xml:id="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs">
    <statement>
      <p> Find the number of integer solutions to the equation <me>
          x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = n
        </me> (<m>n\geq 0</m> an integer) with <m>x_1
        \geq 0</m> even, <m>x_2\geq 0</m>, and <m>0\leq x_3\leq 2</m>. </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Again, we want to look at the generating function we would have if each variable existed
        individually and take their product. For <m>x_1</m>, we get a factor of <m>1/(1-x^2)</m>;
        for <m>x_2</m>, we have <m>1/(1-x)</m>; and for <m>x_3</m> our factor is <m>(1+x+x^2)</m>.
        Therefore, the generating function for the number of solutions to the equation above is <me>
        \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1-x)(1-x^2)} = \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1+x)(1-x)^2}.
        </me>
        In calculus, when we wanted to integrate a rational function of this form, we would use the
        method of partial fractions to write it as a sum of <q>simpler</q> rational functions whose
        antiderivatives we recognized. Here, our technique is the same, as we can readily recognize
        the formal power series for many rational functions. Our goal is to write <me>
        \frac{1+x+x^2}{(1+x)(1-x)^2} = \frac{A}{1+x} + \frac{B}{1-x} +
          \frac{C}{(1-x)^2}
        </me>
        for appropriate constants, <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>. To find the constants, we clear
        the denominators, giving <me>
          1+x+x^2 = A(1-x)^2 + B(1-x^2) + C(1+x).
        </me> Equating
        coefficients on terms of equal degree, we have: <md>
          <mrow> 1 \amp = A+B+C</mrow>
          <mrow> 1 \amp = -2A + C</mrow>
          <mrow> 1 \amp = A - B</mrow>
        </md> Solving the system, we find <m>A=1/4</m>, <m>
        B=-3/4</m>, and <m>C=3/2</m>. Therefore, our generating function is <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{1+x} -\frac{3}{4} \frac{1}{1-x} +\frac{3}{2}
            \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>=\amp \frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^n -
            \frac{3}{4} \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n + \frac{3}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty n
            x^{n-1}</mrow>
        </md>. </p>
      <p>The solution to our question is thus the coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in the above generating
        function, which is <me>
          \frac{(-1)^n}{4} - \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3(n+1)}{2},
        </me> a
        surprising answer that would not be too easy to come up with via other methods! </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>The invocation of partial fractions in <xref ref="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs" /> is
    powerful, but solving the necessary system of equations and then hoping that the resulting
    formal power series have expansions we immediately recognize can be a challenge. If <xref
      ref="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs" /> had not asked about the general case with <m>n</m> on
    the right-hand side of the equation but instead asked specifically about <m>n=30</m>, you might
    be wondering if it would just be faster to write some Python code to generate all the solutions
    or more interesting to huddle up and devise some clever strategy to count them. Fortunately,
    technology can help us out when working with generating functions. In SageMath, we can use the <c>
    series()</c> method to get the power series expansion of a given function. The two arguments to <c>
    series</c> are the variable and the degree of the terms you want to truncate. In the cell below,
    we ask SageMath to expand the generating function from <xref ref="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs" />
    by giving us all the terms of degree at most 30 and then collapsing the rest of the series into
    its form of big-Oh notation, which we discard by storing the output from <c>series()</c> in a
    polynomial <c>f(x)</c>. </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      # Note that SageMath doesn't do well with implied
      # multiplication, so use lots of *'s in addition to lots
      # of parentheses.
      f(x)= ((1+x+x^2)/((1+x)*(1-x)^2)).series(x,31)
      f(x)
    </input>
    <output>
      46*x^30 + 44*x^29 + 43*x^28 + 41*x^27 + 40*x^26 + 38*x^25 + 37*x^24 + 35*x^23 + 34*x^22 +
      32*x^21 + 31*x^20 + 29*x^19 + 28*x^18 + 26*x^17 + 25*x^16 + 23*x^15 + 22*x^14 + 20*x^13 +
      19*x^12 + 17*x^11 + 16*x^10 + 14*x^9 + 13*x^8 + 11*x^7 + 10*x^6 + 8*x^5 + 7*x^4 + 5*x^3 +
      4*x^2 + 2*x + 1
    </output>
  </sage>
  <p>If all we really want is the coefficient on a specific term, we can use the <c>list()</c>
    method to turn the polynomial into a list of its coefficients and then index into that list
    using standard SageMath or Python syntax:</p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      coeffs=f(x).list()
      coeffs[30]
    </input>
    <output>
      46
    </output>
  </sage>
  <p>Let's see that the answer agrees with what our formula in the solution to <xref
      ref="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs" /> gives us for <m>n=30</m>:</p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      n=30
      (-1)^n/4 - (3/4) + 3*(n+1)/2
    </input>
    <output>
      46
    </output>
  </sage>
  <p>That's a relief, and so long as we only need a single coefficient, we're now in good shape. But
    what if we really need a formula for the coefficient on <m>x^n</m> in general? Let's see how we
    can use SageMath to help us with some of the other steps in <xref
      ref="exa_genfunction_partial-fracs" />. The first thing we'll want is the <c>
    partial_fraction()</c> method:</p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      ((1+x+x^2)/((1+x)*(1-x)^2)).partial_fraction()
    </input>
    <output>
      1/4/(x + 1) + 3/4/(x - 1) + 3/2/(x - 1)^2
    </output>
  </sage>
  <p>If you don't like the way that looks, the <c>pretty_print()</c> function can make it easier to
    read:</p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      pretty_print(((1+x+x^2)/((1+x)*(1-x)^2)).partial_fraction())
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>Up to the location of a minus sign, this is what we got by hand, but we get it much faster!
    From this stage, it's frequently possible to use our knowledge of certain fundamental power
    series that appear when doing the partial fractions expansion to come up with the general form
    for the coefficient on an arbitrary term of the power series. To facilitate this, we close this
    section with an example that illustrates how we can use solutions to counting problems we have
    already studied in order to figure out the coefficients on generating functions.</p>
  <example xml:id="exa_genfunction_multisets">
    <statement>
      <p> Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. What is the coefficient on <m>x^k</m> in the
        generating function <me>\frac{1}{(1-x)^n}</me>? </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> We have already encountered the case <m>n=5</m> in the midst of working on <xref
          ref="exa_genfunction_apples" />, but there we appealed to calculus. Let's take a look at
        this from the perspective of just counting. The generating function <m>1/(1-x) =
        1+x+x^2+\cdots</m> encodes the sequence for the number of ways to distribute <m>n</m> apples
        to <em>one</em> child. There's only one way to do that task: give the lucky kid all the
        apples. Multiplying together a bunch of copies of <m>1/(1-x)</m> then serves to increase the
        number of children to whom the apples are being distributed, and since each power series
        being multiplied starts with <m>1</m>, we are in the situation where the number of apples
        each child receives must be <em>nonnegative</em>. This is therefore a problem from <xref
          ref="s_strings_bin-coeff" />. We have <m>n</m> children and the coefficient on <m>x^k</m>
        is the number of ways of distributing <m>k</m> apples to them. This requires <m>n</m>
        artificial apples, so we distribute <m>k+n</m> apples, which determine <m>k+n-1</m> gaps and
        we must choose <m>n-1</m> of them as the locations for dividers. Therefore, we can conclude
        that <me>\frac{1}{(1-x)^n} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{k+n-1}{n-1}x^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty
        \binom{k+n-1}{k}x^k</me>. It's possible to arrive at this conclusion using techniques from
        calculus, but there are a lot of factorials and <m>-1</m>s to monitor, so this combinatorial
        approach may be less error prone!</p>
