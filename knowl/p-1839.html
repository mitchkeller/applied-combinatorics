<em class="emphasis">Carlos</em> switched from Physics to math for graduate school and won an NSF graduate fellowship which he took at MIT. After receiving his Ph.D., he took a postdoctoral position at the American Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). He also won an NSF Career grant.  Carlos is a rapidly emerging star in the academic world. He has universities lining up to offer him tenure-track positions and he had already been invited to lecture in England, France, Germany, Hungary and Poland. Heâ€™ll make a good living, not a huge salary, but the quality of life will rank with the best. He is very happy.</div>
