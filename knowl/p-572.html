<div class="para">We close this section with a problem that brings the current section together with the topic of graph coloring. In 1852 Francis Guthrie, an Englishman who was at the time studying to be lawyer but subsequently became a professor of mathematics in South Africa, was trying to color a map of the counties of England so that any two counties that shared a boundary segment (meaning they touched in more than a single point) were colored with different colors. He noticed that he only needed four colors to do this, and was unable to draw any sort of map that would require five colors. (He was able to find a map that required four colors, an example of which is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_needs-four-colors.html" title="Figure 5.36">FigureÂ 5.36</a>.)</div>
