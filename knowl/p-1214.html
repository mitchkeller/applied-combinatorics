<div class="para">Despite thinking the material of this chapter was interesting, Bob also wondered if they really needed all of this machinery. “Defining a recursive function is easy in almost all programming languages, so why not just use a computer to calculate the values you need?”<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> Xing started to remark that the techniques of this chapter could provide a good way to understand the growth rate of recursive functions in terms of the big Oh notation of <a href="ch_basics.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Combinatorial Basics">Chapter 4</a>, but Alice interrupted to propose a programming experiment as something that would raise her spirits.
