  <title>Binary Relations and Functions</title>
  <p permid="JcV">
    A subset <m>R\subseteq X\times Y</m> is called a
    <term>binary relation</term>
        <idx><h>relation</h><h>binary</h></idx>
    on <m>X\times Y</m>,
    and a binary relation <m>R</m> on <m>X\times Y</m> is called a
    <term>function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m></term>
        <idx><h>function</h></idx>
    when for every <m>x\in X</m>,
    there is <em>exactly one</em>
    element <m>y\in Y</m> for which <m>(x,y)\in R</m>.
  </p>

  <p permid="pke">
    Many authors prefer to write the condition for being a function in two parts:

    <ol permid="TCa">
      <li permid="zJj">
        <p permid="Etc">
          For every <m>x\in X</m>,
          there is <em>some</em> element <m>y\in Y</m> for which <m>(x,y)\in R</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li permid="fQs" xml:id="cond_function-at-most-one">

        <p permid="kAl">
          For every <m>x\in X</m>,
          there is <em>at most one</em> element <m>y\in Y</m> for which <m>(x,y)\in R</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p permid="Vrn">
    The second condition is often stated in the following alternative form: If <m>x\in X</m>,
    <m>y_1,y_2\in Y</m> and <m>(x,y_1),(x,y_2)\in R</m>, then
    <m>y_1=y_2</m>.
  </p>

  <example permid="bgz" xml:id="exa_function">
    <p permid="wOD">
      For example, let <m>X=[4]</m> and <m>Y=[5]</m>.
      Then let
      <md permid="yDQ">
        <mrow>R_1\amp =\{(2,1),(4,2),(1,1),(3,1)\}</mrow>
        <mrow>R_2\amp =\{(4,2),(1,5),(3,2)\}</mrow>
        <mrow>R_3\amp=\{(3,2),(1,4),(2,2),(1,1),(4,5)\}</mrow>
      </md>
      Of these relations,
      only <m>R_1</m> is a function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p permid="Byw">
    In many settings
    (like calculus),
    it is customary to use letters like <m>f</m>,
    <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> to denote functions.
    So let <m>f</m> be a function from a set <m>X</m> to a set <m>Y</m>.
    In view of the defining properties of functions, for each <m>x\in X</m>,
    there is a unique element <m>y\in Y</m> with <m>(x,y)\in f</m>.
    And in this case, the convention is to write <m>y=f(x)</m>.
    For example,
    if <m>f=R_1</m> is the function in <xref ref="exa_function" />, then <m>2=f(4)</m> and <m>f(3) =1</m>.
  </p>

  <p permid="hFF">
    The shorthand notation <m>f:X\rightarrow Y</m> is used to indicate that <m>f</m> is a function from the set <m>X</m> to the set <m>Y</m>.

    <notation>
      <usage>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</usage>
      <description><m>f</m> is a function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m></description>
    </notation>

  </p>

  <p permid="NMO">
    In calculus, we study functions defined by algebraic rules.
    For example,
    consider the function <m>f</m> whose rule is <m>f(x) = 5x^3-8x+7</m>.
    This short hand notation means that <m>X=Y=\reals</m> and that
    <me permid="eKZ">
      f=\{(x,5x^3-8x+7):x\in\reals\}
    </me>
    In combinatorics,
    we sometimes study functions defined algebraically, just like in calculus,
    but we will frequently describe functions by other kinds of rules.
    For example,
    let <m>f:\posints\rightarrow\posints</m> be defined by
    <m>f(n) = |n/2|</m> if <m>n</m> is even and
    <m>f(n)=3|n|+1</m> when <m>n</m> is odd.
  </p>

  <p permid="tTX">
    A function <m>f:X\rightarrow Y</m> is called an <term>injection</term> 
        <idx><h>injection</h></idx>
    from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> when
    for every <m>y\in Y</m>, there is
    <em>at most</em> one element
    <m>x\in X</m> with <m>y=f(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <p permid="abg">
    When the meaning of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> is clear,
    we just say <m>f</m> is an <term>injection</term>.
    An injection is also called a <m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m> function
    (read this as <q>one to one</q>)
    and this is sometimes denoted as <m>f:X\injection Y</m>.

    <notation>
      <usage>f:X\injection Y</usage>
      <description><m>f</m> is an injection from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m></description>
    </notation>

        <idx><h>function</h><h>one-to-one</h></idx>
  </p>

  <p permid="Gip">
    A function <m>f:X\rightarrow Y</m> is called a <term>surjection</term>
        <idx><h>surjection</h></idx>
    from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> when for every <m>y\in Y</m>,
    there is <em>at least</em> one <m>x\in X</m> with <m>y=f(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <p permid="mpy">
    Again, when the meaning of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> is clear,
    we just say <m>f</m> is a <term>surjection</term>.
    A surjection is also called an <term>onto function</term>
        <idx><h>function</h><h>onto</h></idx>
    and this is sometimes denoted as <m>f:X\surjection Y</m>.

    <notation>
      <usage>f\colon X\surjection Y</usage>
      <description><m>f</m> is a surjection from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m></description>
    </notation>

  </p>

  <p permid="SwH">
    A function <m>f</m> from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> which is both an injection and a surjection is called a <term>bijection</term>.
        <idx><h>bijection</h></idx>
    Alternatively,
    a bijection is referred to as a <m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m>,
    onto function,
    and this is sometimes denoted as <m>f:X \bijection Y</m>

    <notation>
      <usage>f\colon X\bijection Y</usage>
      <description><m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m></description>
    </notation>

    . A bijection is also called a <term><m>1</m><ndash /><m>1</m>-correspondence</term>.
  </p>

  <example permid="HnI">
    <p permid="cVM">
      Let <m>X=Y=\reals</m>.
      Then let <m>f</m>, <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> be the functions defined by

      <ol permid="nuR">
        <li permid="LXB"><m>f(x)=3x-7</m>.</li>

        <li permid="seK"><m>g(x)=3(x-2)(x+5)(x-7)</m>.</li>

        <li permid="YlT"><m>h(x)=6x^2-5x+13</m>.</li>
      </ol>

      Then <m>f</m> is a bijection;
      <m>g</m> is a surjection but not an injection (<em>Why</em>?);
      and <m>h</m> is neither an injection nor a surjection
      (<em>Why</em>?).

  <proposition permid="uZq">
    <statement>
      <p permid="QHu">
        Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be sets.
