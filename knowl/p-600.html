<div class="para">Over coffee, today’s conversation was enthusiastic and heated at times. Zori got things off with a blast “I don’t think graphs are of any use at all…” but she wasn’t even able to finish the sentence before Yolanda uncharacteristically interrupted her with “You’re off base on this one. I see lots of ways graphs can be used to model real world problems. The professor actually showed us examples back in our first class. But now that we’re talking in more depth about graphs, things are even clearer.” Bob added, “These eulerian and hamiltonian cycle problems are certain to have applications in network routing problems.” Xing reinforced Bob with “Absolutely. There are important questions in network integrity and information exchange that are very much the same as these basic problems.” Alice piled on “Even the notion of chromatic number clearly has practical applications.” By this time, Zori realized her position was indefensible but she was reluctant to admit it. She offered only a “Whatever.”</div>
