<div class="para">For the first fact, it suffices to note that if there were more than one distinct path from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\text{,}\)</span> we would be able to find a cycle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\text{.}\)</span> This is impossible since it is a tree. For the second, we refer to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_graphalgorithms_exchange.html" title="Figure 12.5">FigureÂ 12.5</a>. The black and green edges in the graph shown at the left represent the spanning tree <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> lies on the unique path from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e=xy\)</span> is an edge of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> <em class="emphasis">not</em> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\text{.}\)</span> Adding <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> creates a graph with a unique cycle, since <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> had a unique path from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Removing <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> (which could be any edge <span class="process-math">\(f_i\)</span> of the path, as stated in the proposition) destroys this cycle. Thus <span class="process-math">\(\bfT_i\)</span> is a connected acyclic subgraph of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n-1+1-1=n-1\)</span> edges, so it is a spanning tree.</div>
