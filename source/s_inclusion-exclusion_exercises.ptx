            <p>A school has <m>147</m> third graders. The third grade teachers have planned a special treat for the last day of school and brought ice cream for their students. There are three flavors: mint chip, chocolate, and strawberry. Suppose that <m>60</m> students like (at least) mint chip, <m>103</m> like chocolate, <m>50</m> like strawberry, <m>30</m> like mint chip and strawberry, <m>40</m> like mint chip and chocolate, <m>25</m> like chocolate and strawberry, and <m>18</m> like all three flavors. How many students don't like any of the flavors available?</p>

            <p>There are <m>1189</m> students majoring in computer science at a particular university. They are surveyed about their knowledge of three programming languages: C++, Java, and Python. The survey results reflect that <m>856</m> students know C++, <m>792</m> know Java, and <m>692</m> know Python. Additionally, <m>639</m> students know both C++ and Java, <m>519</m> know both C++ and Python, and <m>632</m> know both Java and Python. There are <m>488</m> students who report knowing all three languages. How many students reported that they did not know any of the three programming languages?</p>
