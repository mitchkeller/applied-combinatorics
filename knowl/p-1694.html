<div class="para">Since we’re only after the cycle index of <span class="process-math">\(S_4^{(2)}\text{,}\)</span> we don’t need to find all <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> permutations in the pair group. However, we do need to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples we’ve considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair group doesn’t depend on the original permutation in <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> other than for <em class="emphasis">its</em> cycle structure. Any permutation in <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> consisting of a <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle and two <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles will correspond to a permutation with two <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles and two <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles in <span class="process-math">\(S_4^{(2)}\text{.}\)</span> A permutation in <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> with one <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycle and one <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycle will correspond to a permutation with two <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycles in the pair group. By considering an example of a permutation in <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> consisting of a single <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle, we find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle and a <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle. Finally, a permutation of <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> consisting of two <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles corresponds to a permutation in <span class="process-math">\(S_4^{(2)}\)</span> having two <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles and two <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles.
