<div class="para">Many combinatorial problems admit “exact” solutions, and in these cases, we will usually try hard to find them. The <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_ErdosSzekeres.html" title="Theorem 4.2: Erdős/Szekeres Theorem">Erdős/Szekeres Theorem</a> from earlier in this chapter is a good example of an “exact” result<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. By this statement, we mean that for each pair <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of positive integers, there is a sequence of <span class="process-math">\(mn\)</span> distinct real numbers that has neither an increasing subsequence of size <span class="process-math">\(m+1\)</span> nor a decreasing subsequence of size <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span> To see this, consider the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> defined as follows: For each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,m\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(B_i=\{j+(m-1)i:1\le j\le n\}\text{.}\)</span> Note that each <span class="process-math">\(B_i\)</span> is a block of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> consecutive integers. Then define a permutation <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> of the first <span class="process-math">\(mn\)</span> integers by setting <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\lt \beta\)</span> if there exist distinct integers <span class="process-math">\(i_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(i_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\in B_{i_1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\in B_{i_2}\text{.}\)</span> Also, for each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,m\text{,}\)</span> set <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\lt \beta\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(1+(m-1)i\le \beta\lt \alpha\le n+(m-1)i\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, any increasing subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> contains at most one member from each block, so <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> has no increasing sequence of size <span class="process-math">\(m=1\text{.}\)</span>  On the other hand, any decreasing sequence in <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is contained in a single block, so <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> has no decreasing sequence of size <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span>
