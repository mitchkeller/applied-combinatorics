<div class="para">A recurring problem so far in this book has been to consider problems that ask about distributing indistinguishable objects (say apples) to distinct entities (say children). We started in <a href="ch_strings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients">Chapter 2</a> by asking how many ways there were to distribute <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> apples to <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> children so that each child is guaranteed to get at least one apple and saw that the answer was <span class="process-math">\(C(39,4)\text{.}\)</span> We even saw how to restrict the situation so that one of the children was limited and could receive at most <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> apples. In <a href="ch_inclusion-exclusion.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: Inclusion-Exclusion">Chapter 7</a>, we learned how to extend the restrictions so that more than one child had restrictions on the number of apples allowed by taking advantage of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_inclusion-exclusion.html" title="Theorem 7.7: Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion">Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</a>. Before moving on to see how generating functions can allow us to get even more creative with our restrictions, let’s take a moment to see how generating functions would allow us to solve the most basic problem at hand.</div>
