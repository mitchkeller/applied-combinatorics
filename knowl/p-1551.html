<div class="para">This process will be repeated until (and we will see that this always occurs) we reach a point where the labeling halts with some vertices labeled (one of these is the source) and some vertices unlabeled (one of these is the sink). We will then note that the partition <span class="process-math">\(V= L\cup U\)</span> into labeled and unlabeled vertices (hence our choice of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> as names) is a cut whose capacity is exactly equal to the value of the current flow. This resolves the debate from earlier in the chapter and says that the maximum flow/minimum cut question is more like antichains and partitioning into chains than clique number and chromatic number. In particular, the labeling algorithm will provide a proof of the following theorem:</div>
