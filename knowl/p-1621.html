<div class="para">Students are preparing to do final projects for an applied combinatorics course. The five possible topics for their final projects are graph algorithms, posets, induction, graph theory, and generating functions. There are five students in the class, and they have each given their professor the list of topics on which they are willing to do their project. Alice is interested in posets or graphs. Bob would be willing to do his project on graph algorithms, posets, or induction. Carlos will only consider posets or graphs. Dave likes generating functions and induction. Yolanda wants to do her project on either graphs or posets.  To prevent unauthorized collaboration, the professor does not want to have two students work on the same topic. Is it possible to assign each student a topic from the lists above so that no two students work on the same project? If so, find such an assignment. If not, find an assignment that maximizes the number of students who have assignments from their lists and explain why you cannot satisfy all the studentsâ€™ requests.</div>
