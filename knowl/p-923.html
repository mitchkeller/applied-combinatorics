<div class="para">At a very small school, there is a class with nine students in it. The students, whom we will denote as <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> walk from their classroom to the lunchroom in the order <span class="process-math">\(ABCDEFGHI\text{.}\)</span> (Let’s say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is at the front of the line.) On the way back to their classroom after lunch, they would like to walk in an order so that no student walks immediately behind the same classmate he or she was behind on the way to lunch. (For instance, <span class="process-math">\(ACBDIHGFE\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(IHGFEDCBA\)</span> would meet their criteria. However, they would not be happy with <span class="process-math">\(CEFGBADHI\)</span> since it contains <span class="process-math">\(FG\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(HI\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is following <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> again and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is following <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> again.)</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">One student ponders how many possible ways there would be for them to line up meeting this criterion. Help him out by determining the exact value of this number.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Is this number bigger than, smaller than, or equal to the number of ways they could return so that no student walks in the same position as before (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not first, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is not second, …, and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is not last)?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What fraction (give it as a decimal) of the total number of ways they could line up meet their criterion of no student following immediately behind the same student on the return trip?</div></li>
