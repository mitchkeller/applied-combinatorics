<div class="para">Computer algebra systems can be powerful tools for working with generating functions. However, unless an exercise specifically suggests that you use a computer algebra system, we strongly encourage you to solve the problem by hand. This will help you develop a better understanding of how generating functions can be used. You might consider editing the content of the SageMathCells in <a href="s_genfunction_distributions.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.2: Another look at distributing apples or folders">SectionÂ 8.2</a> to assist with solving problems here where a computer algebra system is suggested, and in some cases, we have included a SageMathCell within the exercise for you to use.</div>
