</div> <div class="para">For the upper bound, let <span class="process-math">\(\cgF\)</span> be a family of subsets of <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> satisfying the two constraints.

Then there are <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> different ways (one for each permutation <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span>) to place the integers in <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> at the points in <span class="process-math">\(\{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n\}\)</span> in one to one manner.</div> <div class="para">For each permutation <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\([n]\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\cgF(\sigma)\)</span> denote the subfamily of <span class="process-math">\(\cgF\)</span> consisting of all sets <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\cgF\)</span> whose elements occur in a consecutive block around the circle.

Note that since <span class="process-math">\(n\ge 2k\text{,}\)</span> this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> whose elements are the first <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in a clockwise sense within this block.  Since each other set in <span class="process-math">\(\cgF\)</span> represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that <span class="process-math">\(|\cgF|\le k\text{.}\)</span> Since there are <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> permutations, the claim follows.</div> <div class="para">We now claim that for each set <span class="process-math">\(S\in\cgF\text{,}\)</span> there are exactly <span class="process-math">\(n k!(n-k)!\)</span> permutations <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(S\in\cgF(\sigma)\text{.}\)</span> Note that there are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> positions around the circle and each can be used as the first point in a block of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> consecutive positions in which the elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be placed.
