How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant or end with a -digit number divisible by ?    We have to be careful here, because if we try adding the answers to the first two parts together, then we have counted license plates such as EGA105 twice, since this is a vowel-consonant plate and a divisible by 5 plate. We can deal with this by subtracting the answer to the third part, as the plates that are both vowel-consonant plates and divisible by 5 plates are exactly those that are counted twice.

A grid of dots. There are 13 columns of dots and 8 rows of dots. The dot in the lower left corner is labeled . The dot in the upper right corner is labeled . There is a path marked on the grid between these dots. The path moves only to the right and up. It consists of three moves to the right, two moves up, one move right, one move up, one move right, three moves up, five moves right, one move up, one move right, one move up, and two moves right.    We need 13 H's and 8 V's to move from to . Thus, we need a string of length 21 that has exactly 13 H's and exactly 8 V's. There are such strings, so this is also the number of lattice paths.      The town of Mascotville is laid out as a grid. There are seven parallel streets ( through ) that run north-south and five parallel avenues ( through ) that run east-west.     Buzz starts at the intersection of Street and Avenue and wants to get to Bucky's burrow at the intersection of Street and Avenue traveling only on streets\/avenues, and always moving toward Bucky's burrow. How many ways can he do this?           The Varsity is at the intersection of Street and Avenue. How many ways can Buzz get to Bucky's burrow if he insists on stopping at The Varsity?           Suppose Buzz is put on a diet and prohibited from eating at The Varsity. He knows if he goes by it, he'll stop and eat, so he must avoid it completely. How many ways are there for him to get to Bucky's burrow that avoid The Varsity?    We count all the lattice paths and subtract those that go through The Varsity, so we have .      How many lattice paths are there from to that do not cross the line ? (Lattice paths are allowed to touch the line.)   We will count the number of bad lattice paths (those that cross ) and subtract from the total number of lattice paths, which is .   Peer instruction question 1   We establish a 1-1 correspondence between all lattice paths from to and the bad lattice paths from to .   Take a bad lattice path from to and find the first place that it crosses the line . After that point, change every H into a V (and vice versa). At this moment, there must be H's and V's for some in the first part of the string and thus H's and V's in the second part of the string. After the swap, we thus have H's and V's. Thus, this new lattice path is one from to .   Pause for Peer Instruction question 2     Every lattice path from to must cross the line because it starts on the line and ends above it. Therefore, there is a first time such a lattice path is above the line. Do the H\/V swap after that point, and now we have a lattice path that ends at but that is bad because we preserved being above the line.   This means there are bad lattice paths, so the total number of good lattice paths is . We call this number the Catalan number        Find a - correspondence between the set of good lattice paths and each of the following sets:     Sequences of  's and  's in which the sum of the first terms is non-negative for all .
