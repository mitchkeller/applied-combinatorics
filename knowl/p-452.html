<div class="para">The famous question is to determine whether the two classes are the same. Evidently, any problem belonging to <span class="process-math">\(\cgP\)</span> also belongs to <span class="process-math">\(\cgN\cgP\text{,}\)</span> i.e, <span class="process-math">\(\cgP\subseteq\cgN\cgP\text{,}\)</span> but are they equal?  It seems difficult to believe that there is a polynomial time algorithm for settling the third problem (the subset sum problem), and no one has come close to settling this issue. But if you get a good idea, be sure to discuss it with one or both authors of this text before you go public with your news. If it turns out that you are right, you are certain to treasure a photo opportunity with yours truly.</div>
