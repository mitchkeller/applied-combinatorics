<div class="para">Dave wasn’t biting on this topic. Instead he offered “You have to be struck by the statements that it appears difficult to construct objects which you can prove exist in abundance. I wonder why this is so.” Alice said “We all find your brain to be a totally random thing, sometimes making sense but often not.” There was laughter or at least some snickering. But after a bit, Carlos said “There’s something fundamental here. Maybe one could prove that there are easily stated theorems which only have long proofs.” Bob blurted “That doens’t make any sense.” Zori saw an opportunity where a client would, at considerable expense, commission her to solve a problem (at least better than the competition) that was readily understood but somehow difficult in the end.
