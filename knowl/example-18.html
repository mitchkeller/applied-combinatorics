<div class="para">Let’s return to the license plate question of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_strings_ga-plate.html" title="Example 2.1">Example 2.1</a>. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having <span class="process-math">\(26^3=17\,576\)</span> ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we’d have <span class="process-math">\(P(26,3) = 26\times 25\times 24 = 15\,600\)</span> options, giving a total of <span class="process-math">\(140\,400\,000\)</span> license plates.</div> <div class="para">As another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> options for the first position and <span class="process-math">\(26^3\)</span> options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in <span class="process-math">\(P(10,3)\)</span> ways. The total number of license plates would then be <span class="process-math">\(9\times
P(10,3)\times 26^3\text{.}\)</span> If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> chosen from the remaining <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> digits. Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(9\times P(9,3)\)</span> ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of <span class="process-math">\(9\times P(9,3)\times 26^3\)</span> license plates.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_strings_permutations.html#example-18" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
