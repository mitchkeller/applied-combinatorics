<div class="para">The materials included in this book have evolved over time. Early versions of a few chapters date from 2004, but the pace quickened in 2006 when the authors team taught a large section of Applied Combinatorics. In the last five years, existing chapters have been updated and expanded, while new chapters have been added. As matters now stand, our book includes more material than we can cover in a single semester. We feel that the topics of Chapters 1â€“9 plus Chapters 12, 13 and 14 are the core of a one semester course in Applied Combinatorics. Additional topics can then be selected from the remaining chapters based on the interests of the instructor and students.</div>
