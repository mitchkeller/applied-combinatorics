<div class="para">We proceed by induction on <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(t=3\text{,}\)</span> we take <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_3\)</span> to be the cycle <span class="process-math">\(\bfC_5\)</span> on five vertices. Now assume that for some <span class="process-math">\(t\ge3\text{,}\)</span> we have determined the graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(n_t\)</span> vertices. Label the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n_t}\text{.}\)</span> Construct <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\)</span> as follows. Begin with an independent set <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> of cardinality <span class="process-math">\(t(n_t-1)+1\text{.}\)</span> For every subset <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|S|=n_t\text{,}\)</span> label the elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{n_t}\text{.}\)</span> For this particular <span class="process-math">\(n_t\)</span>-element subset attach a copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,n_t\text{.}\)</span> Vertices in copies of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> for distinct <span class="process-math">\(n_t\)</span>-element subsets of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> are nonadjacent, and a vertex in <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> has at most one neighbor in a particular copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span>
