<div class="para">Our first claim is that <span class="process-math">\(t\le kn!\text{.}\)</span> To prove this, let <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> be a permutation and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(|\cgF(\sigma)|=s \ge 1\text{.}\)</span> Then the union of the sets from <span class="process-math">\(\cgF(\sigma)\)</span> is a set of points that form a consecutive block of points on the circle. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(n\ge 2k\text{,}\)</span> this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> whose elements are the first <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in a clockwise sense within this block.  Since each other set in <span class="process-math">\(\cgF\)</span> represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that <span class="process-math">\(|\cgF|\le k\text{.}\)</span> Since there are <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> permutations, the claim follows.</div>
