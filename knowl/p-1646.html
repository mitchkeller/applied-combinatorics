<div class="para">Before proceeding to establish the connection between the number of nonequivalent colorings (equivalence classes under <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span>) and the number of colorings fixed by a transformation in full generality, let’s see how it looks for our example. In looking at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_squares.html" title="Figure 15.1">Figure 15.1</a>, you should notice that <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> partitions <span class="process-math">\(\cgC\)</span> into six equivalence classes. Two contain one coloring each (the all white and all gold colorings). One contains two colorings (<span class="process-math">\(C_{10}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{11}\)</span>). Finally, three contain four colorings each (one gold vertex, one white vertex, and the remaining four with two vertices of each color). Now look again at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_fixed-square.html" title="Figure 15.2">Figure 15.2</a> and add up the number of colorings fixed by each transformation. In doing this, we obtain <span class="process-math">\(48\text{,}\)</span> and when <span class="process-math">\(48\)</span> is divided by the number of transformations (<span class="process-math">\(8\)</span>), we get <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> (the number of equivalence classes)! It turns out that this is far from a fluke, as we will soon see. First, however, we introduce the concept of a permutation group to generalize our set of transformations of the square.</div>
