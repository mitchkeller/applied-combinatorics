<title>Applying the Local Lemma</title>
<p>
The list of applications of the Local Lemma has been growing
steadily, as has the interest in how the lemma can be applied
algorithmically, i.e., in a constructive setting. But here
we present one of the early applications to Ramsey theory<mdash />estimating
the Ramsey number <m>(R,3,n)</m>. Recall that we have the basic inequality
<m>R(3,n)\le \binom{n+1}{3}</m> from <xref ref="thm_graphramsey" autoname="yes" />, and it is
natural to turn to the probabilistic method to look for good lower bounds.
But a few minutes thought shows that there are challenges to this
approach.
</p>

<p>
First, let's try a direct computation. Suppose we try a random graph
on <m>t</m> vertices with edge probability <m>p</m>. So we would want no triangles,
and that would say we need <m>t^3p^3=1</m>, i.e., <m>p=1/t</m>. Then we
would want no independent sets of size <m>n</m>, which would require
<m>n^te^{-pn^2}=1</m>, i.e., <m>t\ln n=pn^2</m>, so we can't even make
<m>t</m> larger than <m>n</m>. That's not helpful.
</p>

<p>
We can do a bit better by by allowing some triangles and then removing
one point from each, as was done in the proof for
<xref ref="thm_girth" autoname="yes" />. Along these lines, we would
set <m>t^3p^3=t</m>, i.e., <m>p=t^{-2/3}</m>. And the calculation now
yields the lower bound <m>R(3,n)\ge n^{6/5}/\ln^{-3/5} n</m>, so even
the exponent of <m>n</m> is different from the upper bound.
</p>

<p>
So which one is right, or is the answer somewhere in between?
In a classic 1961 paper, Erd&#337;s used a very clever application
of the probabilistic method to show the existence of a graph from
which a good lower bound could be extracted. His technique
yielded the lower bound <m>R(3,n)\ge n^2/\ln^2 n</m>, so the two
on the exponent of <m>n</m> is correct.
</p>

<p>
Here we will use the Lov&#xe1;sz Local Lemma to obtain this
same lower bound in a much more direct manner. We consider
a random graph on <m>t</m> vertices with edge probability <m>p</m>.
For each <m>3</m>-element subset <m>S</m>, we have the event <m>E_S</m> which is
true when <m>S</m> forms a triangle. For each <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m>, we have
the event <m>E_T</m> which is true when <m>T</m> is an independent set. In
the discussion to follow, we abuse notation slightly and refer to
events <m>E_S</m> and <m>E_T</m> as just <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, respectively. Note
that the probability of <m>S</m> is <m>p^3</m> for each <m>3</m>-element
set <m>S</m>, while the probability of <m>T</m> is <m>q=(1-p)^{C(n,2)}\sim
e^{-pn^2/2}</m> for each <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m>.
</p>

<p>
When we apply the Local Lemma, we will set <m>x=x(S)</m> to be <m>e^2p^3</m>,
for each <m>3</m>-element set <m>S</m>. And we will set <m>y=Y(T)=q^{1/2}\sim
e^{-pn^2/4}</m>. It will be clear in a moment where we got those values.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the neighborhood of an event consists of all sets
in the family which have two or more elements in common.
So the neighborhood of a <m>3</m>-element set <m>S</m> consists of <m>3(t-3)</m>
other <m>3</m>-element sets and <m>C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-3,n-2)</m> sets of size<nbsp /><m>n</m>.
Similarly, the neighborhood of an <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m> consists of <m>C(n,3)+
(t-n)C(n,2)</m> sets of size <m>3</m> and <m>\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}C(n,i)
C(t-n,n-i)</m> other sets of size<nbsp /><m>n</m>. So the basic inequalities
we need to satisfy are:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  p^3 \le \amp  x(1-x)^{3(t-3)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}</mrow>
  <mrow>  q \le \amp  y(1-x)^{C(n,3)+(t-n)C(n,2)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Next, we assume that <m>n^{3/2}\lt t\lt n^2</m> and then make the usual
approximations, ignoring smaller order terms and multiplicative
constants, to see that these inequalities can be considered in
the following simplified form:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  p^3 \le \amp  x(1-x)^{t}(1-y)^{t^n}</mrow>
  <mrow>  q \le \amp  y(1-x)^{tn^2}(1-y)^{t^n}</mrow>
</md>
<p>
A moments reflection makes it clear that
we want to keep the terms involving
<m>(1-y)</m> relatively large, i.e.,
at least <m>1/e</m>. This will certainly be true if
we keep <m>t^n\le 1/y</m>. This is equivalent
to <m>n\ln t\le pn^2</m>, or <m>\ln t\le pn</m>.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, we want to keep the term <m>(1-x)^{t}</m> relatively large,
so we keep <m>t\le 1/x</m>, i.e., <m>t\le 1/p^3</m>. On the other hand,
we want only to keep the term <m>(1-x)^{tn^2}\sim e^{-xtn^2}</m> at least as large
as <m>y</m>. This is equivalent to keeping
<m>p\le xt</m>, and since <m>x\sim p^3</m>, this can be rewritten as <m>p^{-1}\le t^{1/2}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Now we have our marching orders. We just set <m>\ln t=pn</m> and
<m>p^{-1}=t^{1/2}</m>. After substituting, we get <m>t= n^2/\ln^2t</m> and
since <m>\ln t=\ln n</m> (at least within the kind of approximations we
are using), we get the desired result <m>t=n^2/\ln^2n</m>.
