<div class="para">Each of the three problems we have posed is in the form of a “yes/no” question. A “yes” answer to any of the three can be justified by providing a certificate that can be checked efficiently. For example, if you answer the first question with a yes, then you might provide the additional information that you will find <span class="process-math">\(83,172\)</span> as the integer on line <span class="process-math">\(584\)</span> in the input file. Of course, you could also provide the source code for the computer program, and let a referee run the entire procedure.</div>
