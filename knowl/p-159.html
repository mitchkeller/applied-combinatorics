<div class="para">Bob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> interested students is <span class="process-math">\(C(80,4)\text{.}\)</span> However, heâ€™s puzzled about how to compute the value of <span class="process-math">\(C(80,4)\text{.}\)</span> Alice points out that it must be less than <span class="process-math">\(P(80,4)\text{,}\)</span> since each executive council could be turned into <span class="process-math">\(4!\)</span> different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute <span class="process-math">\(C(n,k)\)</span> in general.</div>
