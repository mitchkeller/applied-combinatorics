<em class="emphasis">Zori</em> didnâ€™t go down the pathway through life she once envisioned.  Her first job was with a family owned company making candy bars.  In that position, she helped them to make wise decisions on massive sugar purchases made on a world-wide basis.  She got bored with this job, and left to accept a position with a support group for an airline company. Her group did optimization work, figuring out how best to position aircraft and crews to handle scheduling irregularities.  Two years later, she moved to a position with a major chip maker where she helped optimize the movement of cutting heads in the manufacturing process, where incremental improvements could mean for hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. Zori has made lots of money, but she remains vaguely dissatisfied with life and is still looking for the right environment.</div>
