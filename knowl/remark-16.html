<div class="para">Although Bob’s combinatorial intuition has improved over the course he doesn’t quite understand why we need special algorithms to find minimum weight spanning trees. He figures there can’t be that many spanning trees, so he wants to just write them down. Alice groans as she senses that Bob must have been absent when the material from <a href="s_graphs_counting-trees.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.6: Counting Labeled Trees">Section 5.6</a> was discussed. In that section, we learned that a graph on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices can have as many as <span class="process-math">\(n^{n-2}\)</span> spanning trees (or horrors, the instructor may have left it off the syllabus). Regardless, this exhaustive approach is already unusable when <span class="process-math">\(n = 20\text{.}\)</span> Dave mumbles something about being greedy and just adding the lightest edges one-by-one while never adding an edge that would make a cycle. Zori remembers a strategy like this working for finding the height of a poset, but she’s worried about the nightmare situation that we learned about with using FirstFit to color graphs. Alice agrees that greedy algorithms have an inconsistent track record but suggests that <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem_graphalgorithms_tech.html" title="Lemma 12.6">Lemma 12.6</a> may be enough to get one to succeed here.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_graphalgorithms_min-wt-span.html#remark-16" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
