  "body": " Combinatorial Proofs    Let's go back to license plates allowing any three uppercase letters followed by any three numbers.     How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant?      How many license plates end with a -digit number divisible by ? (Here we allow leading zeros in -digit numbers, unlike in the previous three questions.)      How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant and end with a -digit number divisible by ?      How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant or end with a -digit number divisible by ?        How many ways are there to form a string of length 10 using symbols from the 26-letter uppercase English alphabet if exactly three characters in the string are to elements of the set ? Write a sentence or two to explain your reasoning.      How does your answer change if the characters from the set must be distinct?      Peer instruction question 1   We saw this sum on the handout during our last class:      A square grid of dots. There are 7 rows, each containing 7 dots. There is a box surrounding the dots lying on the diagonal that runs from the upper-left corner of the grid to the lower-right corner of the grid.                   Dots below the box:    Total dots:    Dots in the box:    Dots outside the box:    Dots below the box:    How do the answers to the five bullets above change when the grid is ?        We just saw that . Can we find a proof that counts -element subsets?  Discuss with your group: How many -element subsets of have each number below as the smallest element of ?   1    2    3               for    How can you use this to explain the identity?
