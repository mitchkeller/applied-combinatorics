<div class="para">Suppose that instead of having a bin into which motorists drop the coins to pay their toll, the coins must be inserted one-by-one into a coin slot. In this scenario, Carlos wonders how many ways he could pay the $<span class="process-math">\(0.95\)</span> toll when the order the coins are inserted matters. For instance, in the previous part, the use of three quarters and two dimes would be counted only one time. However, when the coins must be inserted individually into a slot, there are <span class="process-math">\(10=C(5,2)\)</span> ways to insert this combination. Use a generating function and computer algebra system to determine the number of ways that Carlos could pay the $<span class="process-math">\(0.95\)</span> toll when considering the order the coins are inserted.</div>
