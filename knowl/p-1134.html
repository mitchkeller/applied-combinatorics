<div class="para">Before focusing on finding <em class="emphasis">all</em> solutions as we’ve been asked to do, let’s just try to find <em class="emphasis">some</em> solution.

In that example, the polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> we encountered was (while not explicitly stated as such there) <span class="process-math">\(A-2\text{.}\)</span> The solutions to <span class="process-math">\((A-2)f_1=0\)</span> are of the form <span class="process-math">\(f_1(n) = c_12^n\text{.}\)</span> What happens if we try such a function here?

<div class="para">so that <span class="process-math">\(f_1\)</span> is a solution to our given advancement operator equation. Of course, it can’t be <em class="emphasis">all</em> of them. However, it’s not hard to see now that <span class="process-math">\((A+3)f_2 = 0\)</span> has as a solution <span class="process-math">\(f_2(n) = c_2(-3)^n\)</span> by the same reasoning that we used in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_recurrence_adveq.html" title="Example 9.8">Example 9.8</a>. Since <span class="process-math">\((A+3)(A-2) = (A-2)(A+3)\text{,}\)</span> we see right away that <span class="process-math">\(f_2\)</span> is also a solution of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn_recurrence_deg2.html" title="Equation 9.4.1">(9.4.1)</a>.</div>
