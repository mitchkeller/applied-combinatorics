<div class="para">Yes, this is very close to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_genfunction_ineq-clean.html" title="Exercise 8.8.7">Exercise 8.8.7</a>. However, the bounds on <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> are different here. You might try using a computer algebra system to expedite finding the partial fractions expansion, which will have several terms whose power series you can work with quickly. For the term involving <span class="process-math">\(1/(1+x^2)\text{,}\)</span> work out the series by hand. You may find that your solution to this problem has two parts—one for when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even and another for when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd.</div>
