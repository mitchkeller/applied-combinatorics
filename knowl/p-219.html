<div class="para">Undeterred, Dave continued, “What about exponentiation? Can your software calculate <span class="process-math">\(a^b\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are large integers?”  Xing said “That shouldn’t be a problem. After all, <span class="process-math">\(a^b\)</span> is just multiplying <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> times itself a total of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> times, and if you can do multiplication quickly, that’s just a loop.” Yolanda said that the way Xing was describing things, he was actually talking about a program with nested loops so it might take a long time for such a program to halt. Carlos was quiet but he thought there might be ways to speed up such computations.</div>
