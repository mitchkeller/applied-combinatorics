<div class="para">Consider a network in which the source <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> has precisely three neighbors: <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> Suppose also that <span class="process-math">\(c(S,B)=30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c(S,E)=20\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c(S,F)=25\text{.}\)</span> You know that there is a flow <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> on the network but you do not know how much flow is on any edge. You do know, however, that when the Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm is run on the network with current flow <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{,}\)</span> the first two vertices labeled are <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> with label <span class="process-math">\((*,+,\infty)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> with label <span class="process-math">\((S,+,15)\text{.}\)</span> Use this information to determine the value of the flow <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> and explain how you do so.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_networkflow_exercises.html#exercise-235" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
