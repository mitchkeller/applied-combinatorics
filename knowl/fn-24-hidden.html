<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">Like so many results of mathematics, the crux of the result was originally discovered by someone other than the mathematician whose name is associated with it. J.H. Redfield published this result in 1927, 10 years prior to Pólya’s work. It would take until 1960 for Redfield’s work to be discovered, by which time Pólya’s name was firmly attached to the technique.</div></body>
