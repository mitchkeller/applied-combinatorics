<div class="para">Likewise, a yes for the third question admits a modest size certificate. You need only specify the elements of the subset <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  The referee, who is equipped with a computer, can (a) check to see that all numbers in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> belong to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{;}\)</span> (b) form a list of the subset <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> consisting of those integers in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that do not belong to <span class="process-math">\(A\text{;}\)</span> and (c) compute the sums of the integers in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the integers in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and verify that the two sums are equal. But in this case, you would not provide source code for the algorithm, as there does not appear (at least nothing in our discussion thus far provides one) to be a reasonable strategy for deciding this problem when the problem size is large.</div>
