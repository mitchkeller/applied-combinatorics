<div class="para">A professor is working with six undergraduate research students. He has <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> topics that he would like these students to begin investigating. Since he has been working with Katie for several terms, he wants to ensure that she is given the most challenging topic (and possibly others). Subject to this, in how many ways can he assign the topics to his students if each student must be assigned at least one topic?</div>
