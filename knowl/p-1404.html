<div class="para">Our first goal is to choose the values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> so that with high probability, a random graph does not have an independent set of size <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> You might think as a second goal, we would try to get a random graph without small cycles. But this goal is too restrictive. Instead, we just try to get a graph in which there are relatively few small cycles. In fact, we want the number of small cycles to be less than <span class="process-math">\(n/2\text{.}\)</span> Then we will remove one vertex from each small cycles, resulting in a graph with at least <span class="process-math">\(n/2\)</span> vertices, having no small cycles and no independent set of sizeÂ <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> The chromatic number of this graph is at least <span class="process-math">\(n/2s\text{,}\)</span> so we will want to have the inequality <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;2st\text{.}\)</span>
