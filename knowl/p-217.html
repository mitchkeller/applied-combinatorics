<div class="para">Dave took up Bob’s case by remarking, “Very few humans, not even you Alice, would want to tackle finding the product of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> by hand.” Xing jumped back in with, “That’s the point. Even a tiny netbook can find the product very, very quickly. In fact, I tried it out with two integers, each having more than one thousand digits. It found the product in about one second.” Ever the skeptic, Zori said, “You mean you carefully typed in two integers of that size?” Xing quickly replied “Of course not. I just copied and pasted the data from one source to another.” Yolanda said, “What a neat trick that is. Really cuts down the chance of an error.”</div>
