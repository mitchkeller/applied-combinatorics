<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(0\lt p\lt 1\)</span> and consider a series of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> Bernoulli trials with the probability of success being <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> count the number of successes. We have already noted that <span class="process-math">\(E(X)=np\text{.}\)</span> Now we claim the variance of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is given by:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\var(X)=\sum_{i=0}^n (i-np)^2\binom{n}{i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i} = np(1-p)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">There are several ways to establish this claim. One way is to proceed directly from the definition, using the same method we used previously to obtain the expectation. But now you need also to calculate the second derivative. Here is a second approach, one that capitalizes on the fact that separate trials in a Bernoulli series are independent.</div>
