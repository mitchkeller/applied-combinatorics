<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> consist of the digits <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1,2,\dots,9\}\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> be the singleton set whose only element is a space, and let <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> denote the set of capital letters.

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(X-\{0\})\times X\times X\times X\times Y\times Z\times Z\times Z
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">so the number of different license plates is <span class="process-math">\(9\times10^3\times1\times 26^3=158\,184\,000\text{,}\)</span> since the size of a product of sets is the product of the sets’ sizes. We can get a feel for why this is the case by focusing just on the digit part of the string here. We can think about the digits portion as being four blanks that need to be filled. The first blank has <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> options (the digits <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span>). If we focus on just the digit strings beginning with <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> one perspective is that they range from <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1999\text{,}\)</span> so there are <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> of them. However, we could also think about there being <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> options for the second spot, <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> options for the third spot, and <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> options for the fourth. Multiplying <span class="process-math">\(10\times 10\times 10\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(1000\text{.}\)</span> Since our analysis of filling the remaining digit blanks didn’t depend on our choice of a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> for the first position, we see that each of the <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> choices of initial digit gives <span class="process-math">\(1\, 000\)</span> strings, for a total of <span class="process-math">\(9\,000 = 9\times 10^3\text{.}\)</span>
