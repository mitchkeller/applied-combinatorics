      Computer algebra systems can be powerful tools for working with generating functions.
      However, unless an exercise specifically suggests that you use a computer algebra system,
      we strongly encourage you to solve the problem by hand.
      This will help you develop a better understanding of how generating functions can be used.
      You might consider editing the content of the SageMathCells in <xref ref="s_genfunction_distributions" /> to assist with solving problems here where a computer algebra system is suggested,
      and in some cases,
      we have included a SageMathCell within the exercise for you to use.

    <p permid="JFY">
      For all exercises in this section,
      <q>generating function</q> should be taken to mean
      <q>ordinary generating function.</q>
      Exponential generating functions are only required in exercises specifically mentioning them.

        Bags of candy are being prepared to distribute to the children at a school.
        The types of candy available are chocolate bites,
        peanut butter cups, peppermint candies, and fruit chews.
        Each bag must contain at least two chocolate bites,
        an even number of peanut butter cups,
        and at most six peppermint candies.
        The fruit chews are available in four different flavors<mdash/>lemon,
        orange, strawberry, and cherry.
        A bag of candy may contain at most two fruit chews,
        which may be of the same or different flavors.
        Beyond the number of pieces of each type of candy included,
        bags of candy are distinguished by using the flavors of the fruit chews included,
        not just the number.
        For example,
        a bag containing two orange fruit chews is different from a bag containing a cherry fruit chew and a strawberry fruit chew,
        even if the number of pieces of each other type of candy is the same.

        Tollbooths in Illinois accept all U.S. coins, including pennies.
        Carlos has a very large supply of pennies, nickels,
        dimes, and quarters in his car as he drives on a tollway.
        He encounters a toll for <dollar/><nbsp /><m>0.95</m> and wonders how many different ways he could use his supply of coins to pay the toll without getting change back. (A computer algebra system is probably the best way to get the required coefficient once you have a generating function,

              In this scenario, Carlos wonders how many ways he could pay the <dollar/><nbsp /><m>0.95</m> toll when the order the coins are inserted matters.
              For instance, in the previous part,
              the use of three quarters and two dimes would be counted only one time.
