Itâ€™s sent to <span class="process-math">\(8\text{,}\)</span> which goes to <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> which goes to <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> which goes to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> completing our first cycle as <span class="process-math">\((13865)\text{.}\)</span> The first integer not in this cycle is <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> which we use to start our next cycle. We find that <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is sent to <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> which is set to <span class="process-math">\(7\text{,}\)</span> which is set to <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the second cycle is <span class="process-math">\((247)\text{.}\)</span> Now all elements of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> are represented in these cycles, so we know that <span class="process-math">\(\pi_3 = (13865)(247)\text{.}\)</span>
