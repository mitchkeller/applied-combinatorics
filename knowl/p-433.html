<div class="para">Many of the algorithms we develop in this book, as well as many of the computer programs that result from these algorithms involve basic steps that are called <dfn class="terminology">operations</dfn>. The meaning of the word operation is intentionally left as an imprecise notion.  An operation might be just comparing two integers to see if they are equal; it might be updating the value of a variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and replacing it by <span class="process-math">\(x^2-3x+7\text{;}\)</span> and it might be checking whether two set sums are equal. In the third instance, we would typically limit the size of the two subsets as well as the integers in them.  As a consequence, we want to be able to say that there is some constant <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> so that an operation can be carried out in time at most <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> on a computer. Different computers yield different values of <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> but that is a discrepancy which we can safely ignore.</div>
