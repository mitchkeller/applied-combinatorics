<div class="para">Problems come in various sizes. The three problems we have discussed in this chapter have the same input size. Roughly speaking this size is <span class="process-math">\(10,000\)</span> blocks, with each block able to hold an integer of size at most <span class="process-math">\(100,000\text{.}\)</span> In this text, we will say that the input size of this problem is <span class="process-math">\(n=10,000\text{,}\)</span> and in some sense ignoring the question of the size of the integers in the set. There are obvious limitations to this approach. We could be given a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of size <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and a candidate element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and be asked whether <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> belongs to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a bit string the size of a typical compact disk, i.e., some <span class="process-math">\(700\)</span> megabytes in length. Just reading the single entry in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to see if it’s exactly <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> will take some time.</div>
