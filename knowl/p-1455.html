<div class="para">Just as with graphs, it is useful to assign weights to the directed edges of a digraph. Specifically, in this section we consider a pair <span class="process-math">\((\bfG,w)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> is a digraph and <span class="process-math">\(w\colon E\rightarrow\nonnegints\)</span> is a function assigning to each directed edge <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> a non-negative weight <span class="process-math">\(w(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> However, in this section, we interpret weight as <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> so that <span class="process-math">\(w(x,y)\)</span> is now called the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of the edge <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(P=(r=u_0,u_1,\dots,u_t=x)\)</span> is a directed path from <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of the path <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is just the sum of the lengths of the edges in the path, <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} w(u_iu_{i+1})\text{.}\)</span> The <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> from <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is then defined to be the minimum length of a directed path from <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Our goal in this section is to solve the following natural problem, which has many applications:</div>
