<div class="para">Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the <span class="process-math">\(9\times 9\)</span> grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group <span class="process-math">\(D_8\)</span> that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_TTT.html" title="Figure 15.16">FigureÂ 15.16</a>. For example, the effect of the transformation <span class="process-math">\(r_1\text{,}\)</span> which rotates the board <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\)</span> clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as <span class="process-math">\((13971)(2684)(5)\text{.}\)</span>
