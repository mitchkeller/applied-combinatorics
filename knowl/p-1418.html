<div class="para">In previous chapters, we have encountered a few algorithms for problems involving discrete structures such as finding euler circuits (<a href="ch_graphs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Graph Theory">Chapter 5</a>) or partitioning a poset into antichains (<a href="ch_posets.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Partially Ordered Sets">Chapter 6</a>). This chapter begins a sequence of three chapters that focus on algorithms. In this chapter we explore two minimization problems for graphs in which we assign a weight to each edge of the graph. The first problem studied is determining a spanning tree of minimum weight. The second is of finding shortest paths from a root vertex to each other vertex in a directed graph.</div>
