<div class="para">The first vertex after <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to be labeled was <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> so we now scan from <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The (unlabeled) neighbors of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to be considered, in order, are <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> This results in the following labels:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig_networkflow_updated-flow.html">
\begin{align*}
A\amp:\quad(B,+,8)\\
C\amp:\quad(B,+,8)\\
D\amp:\quad(B,-,6)
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">The next vertex to be scanned is <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has no unlabeled neighbors, so we then move on to <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> which again has no unlabeled neighbors. Finally, we scan from <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and using the pseudo-alphabetic order, we first consider the sink <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (which in this case is the only remaining unlabeled vertex). This results in the following label for <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig_networkflow_updated-flow.html">
\begin{equation*}
T:\quad(A,+,8)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now that the sink is labeled, we know there is an augmenting path. We discover this path by backtracking. The sink <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> got its label from <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> got its label from <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> got its label from <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>  Therefore, the augmenting path is <span class="process-math">\(P=(S,B,A,T)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\delta=8\text{.}\)</span> All edges on this path are forward. The flow is then updated by increasing the flow on the edges of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span> This results in the flow shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_networkflow_updated-flow.html" title="Figure 13.12">Figure 13.12</a>. The value of this flow is <span class="process-math">\(38\text{.}\)</span>
