<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">The solution involves a “trick” of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by <em class="emphasis">artificially</em> inflating everyone’s allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> folders, we say that he will get <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span> Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of <span class="process-math">\(22=18+4\)</span> folders. Again, choose <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less—and may be zero. So the answer is <span class="process-math">\(C(21,3)\text{.}\)</span>
