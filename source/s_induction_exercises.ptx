        <statement>
            <p>A database uses record identifiers that are alphanumeric strings in which the <m>10</m> decimal digits and <m>26</m> upper-case letters are valid symbols. The criteria that define a valid record identifier are recursive. A valid record identifier of length <m>n\geq 2</m> can be constructed in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>beginning with any upper-case letter other than <m>D</m> and followed by any valid record identifier of length <m>n-1</m>;</li>
                <li>beginning with <m>1C</m>, <m>2K</m>, or <m>7J</m> and followed by any valid record identifier of length <m>n-2</m>; or</li>
                <li>beginning with <m>D</m> and followed by any string of <m>n-1</m> decimal digits.</li>
            </ul>
            Let <m>r(n)</m> denote the number of valid record identifiers of length <m>n</m>. We take <m>r(0)=1</m> and note that <m>r(1) = 26</m>. Find a recursion for <m>r(n)</m> when <m>n\geq 2</m> and use it to compute <m>r(5)</m>.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Consider a <m>1\times n</m> checkerboard. The squares of the checkerboard are to be painted white and gold, but no two consecutive squares may both be painted white. Let <m>p(n)</m> denote the number of ways to paint the checkerboard subject to this rule. Find a recursive formula for <m>p(n)</m> valid for <m>n\geq 3</m>.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Give a recursion for the number <m>g(n)</m> of ternary strings of length <m>n</m> that do not contain <m>102</m> as a substring.</p>

    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>A <m>2\times n</m> checkerboard is to be tiled using two types of tiles. The first tile is a <m>1\times 1</m> square tile. The second tile is called an <m>L</m>-tile and is formed by removing the upper-right <m>1\times 1</m> square from a <m>2\times 2</m> tile. The <m>L</m>-tiles can be used in any of the four ways they can be rotated. (That is, the <q>missing square</q> can be in any of four positions.) Let <m>t(n)</m> denote the number of tilings of the <m>2\times n</m> checkerboard using <m>1\times 1</m> tiles and <m>L</m>-tiles. Find a recursive formula for <m>t(n)</m> and use it to determine <m>t(7)</m>.</p>

            <p>Let <m>S</m> be the set of strings on the alphabet <m>\{0,1,2,3\}</m> that do not contain <m>12</m> or <m>20</m> as a substring. Give a recursion for the number <m>h(n)</m> of strings in <m>S</m> of length <m>n</m>. </p>
