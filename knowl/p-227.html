<li><div class="para">When all <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> students come in from recess together, they again form a single file line. However, this time the students are arranged so that the first student is from group <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> the second from group <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> the third from group <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> and from there on, the students continue to alternate by group in this order.
