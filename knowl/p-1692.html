<div class="para">We begin by considering all <span class="process-math">\(2^{C(n,2)}\)</span> graphs with vertex set <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> and choosing an appropriate permutation group to act in the situation. Since any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex, the symmetric group <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> acts on the vertices. However, we have to be careful about how we find the cycle index here. When we were working with colorings of the vertices of the square, we realized that all the vertices appearing in the same cycle of a permutation <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> had to be colored the same color. Since weâ€™re concerned with edges here and not vertex colorings, what we really need for a permutation to fix a graph is that every edge be sent to an edge and every non-edge be sent to a non-edge. To be specific, if <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an edge of some <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi\in S_4\)</span> fixes <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\{\pi(1),\pi(2)\}\)</span> must also be an edge of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if vertices <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> are not adjacent in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\pi(3)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi(4)\)</span> must also be nonadjacent in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span>
