<title>Enumerating Surjections</title>
<p>
As our first example of the power of inclusion-exclusion, consider the
following situation: A grandfather has <m>15</m> distinct lottery tickets
and wants to distribute them to his four grandchildren so that each
child gets at least one ticket. In how many ways can he make such a
distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of
enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery
tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers <m>1</m>, <m>3</m>,
<m>10</m>, <m>23</m>, <m>47</m>, and <m>50</m> will almost surely not pay out the same
amount as one with the numbers <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, <m>10</m>, <m>30</m>, <m>31</m>, and <m>48</m>,
so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you
have already recognized that the fact that we're dealing with lottery
tickets and grandchildren isn't so important here. Rather, the
important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects
to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set
(lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don't
simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the
number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild
gets a ticket.

<p>
For positive integers <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>, let <m>S(n,m)</m> denote the number of
surjections from <m>[n]</m> to <m>[m]</m>. Note that <m>S(n,m)=0</m> when <m>n\lt m</m>. In
this section, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion formula to determine a
formula for <m>S(n,m)</m>. We start by setting <m>X</m> to be the set of all
functions from <m>[n]</m> to <m>[m]</m>. Then for each <m>f\in X</m> and each
<m>i=1,2,\dots,m</m>, we say that <m>f</m> satisfies property <m>P_i</m> if <m>i</m> is
not in the range of <m>f</m>.
</p>

<lemma>
<statement>
<p>
For each subset <m>S\subseteq [m]</m>, <m>N(S)</m> depends only on <m>|S|</m>. In
fact, if <m>|S|=k</m>, then
</p>
<me>
  N(S)=(m-k)^n.
</me>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>|S|=k</m>. Then a
function <m>f</m> satisfying property <m>P_i</m> for each <m>i\in S</m> is
a string of length <m>n</m> from an alphabet consisting of <m>m-k</m> letters.
This shows that
</p>
<me>
  N(S)=(m-k)^n.
</me>
</proof>

<p>
Now the following result follows immediately from this lemma by
applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, as there are <m>C(m,k)</m>
<m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[m]</m>.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
The number <m>S(n,m)</m> of surjections from <m>[n]</m> to <m>[m]</m> is given by:
</p>
<me>
  S(n,m) = \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k\binom{m}{k}(m-k)^n.
</me>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
For example,
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  S(5,3) \amp = \binom{3}{0}(3-0)^5-\binom{3}{1}(3-1)^5+\binom{3}{2}(3-2)^5-\binom{3}{3}(3-3)^5</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 243 -96+3-0</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 150.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
Returning to our lottery ticket distribution problem at the start of
the section, we see that there are <m>S(15,4)=1016542800</m> ways for the
grandfather to distribute his <m>15</m> lottery tickets so that each of the
<m>4</m> grandchildren receives at least one ticket.
