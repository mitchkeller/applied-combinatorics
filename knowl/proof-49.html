<div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(n=1\text{,}\)</span> all Builder does is present a single vertex. When <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{,}\)</span> two adjacent vertices are enough. When <span class="process-math">\(n=3\text{,}\)</span> Builder constructs a path on <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> vertices as detailed in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_P4.html" title="Example 16.1">Example 16.1</a>.  Now assume that for some <span class="process-math">\(k\ge3\text{,}\)</span> Builder has a strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> for forcing Assigner to use <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> colors on a forest of at most <span class="process-math">\(2^{i-1}\)</span> vertices, for each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,k\text{.}\)</span> Here’s how Builder proceeds to force <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> colors.</div> <div class="para">First, for each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,k\text{,}\)</span> Builder follows strategy <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> to build a forest <span class="process-math">\(F_i\)</span> having at most <span class="process-math">\(2^{i-1}\)</span> vertices on which assigner is forced to use <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> colors. Furthermore, when <span class="process-math">\(1\le i\lt j\le k\text{,}\)</span> there are no edges between vertices in <span class="process-math">\(F_i\)</span> and vertices in <span class="process-math">\(F_j\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Next, Builder chooses a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y_1\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(F_1\text{.}\)</span> Since Assigner uses two colors on <span class="process-math">\(F_2\text{,}\)</span> there is a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y_2\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(F_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\phi(y_2)\neq \phi(y_1)\text{.}\)</span> Since Assigner uses three colors on <span class="process-math">\(F_3\text{,}\)</span> there is a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y_3\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F_3\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\{\phi(y_1),\phi(y_2),\phi(y_3)\}\)</span> are all distinct. It follows that Builder may identify vertices <span class="process-math">\(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_k\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(y_i\in F_i\)</span> so that the colors <span class="process-math">\(\phi(y_i)\)</span> satisfy <span class="process-math">\(\phi(y_i)\neq \phi(y_j)\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(i\neq j\text{.}\)</span> Builder now presents a new vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and declares <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> adjacent to all vertices in <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1,y_2,\dots,y_k\}\)</span> and to no other vertices. Clearly, the resulting graph is a forest and Assigner is forced to use a color for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> distinct from the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> colors she assigned previously to the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1,y_2,\dots, y_k\}\text{.}\)</span> Also, the total number of vertices is at most <span class="process-math">\(1+[1+2+4+8+\dots+2^{k-1}]=2^k\text{.}\)</span>
