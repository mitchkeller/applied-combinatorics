<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(n=10,000\text{.}\)</span> Suppose a friend tells you that he has a secret family of subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\text{,}\)</span> and if you guess it correctly, he will give you one million dollars.  You think you know the family of subsets he has in mind and it contains exactly half the subsets, i.e., the family has <span class="process-math">\(2^{n-1}\)</span> subsets.  Discuss how you can share your hunch with your friend in an effort to win the prize.</div>
