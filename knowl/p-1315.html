<div class="para">Consider the following two situations:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Situation 1.  A small town decides to hold a lottery to raise funds for charitable purposes. A total of <span class="process-math">\(10,001\)</span> tickets are sold, and the tickets are labeled with numbers from the set <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1,2,\dots,10,000\}\text{.}\)</span>  At a public ceremony, duplicate tickets are placed in a big box, and the mayor draws the winning ticket from out of the box. Just to heighten the suspense as to who has actually won the prize, the mayor reports that the winning number is at least <span class="process-math">\(7,500\text{.}\)</span> The citizens ooh and aah and they can’t wait to see who among them will be the final winner.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Situation 2.  Behind a curtain, a fair coin is tossed <span class="process-math">\(10,000\)</span> times, and the number of heads is recorded by an observer, who is reputed to be honest and impartial. Again, the outcome is an integer in the set <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1,2,\dots,10,000\}\text{.}\)</span> The observer then emerges from behind the curtain and announces that the number of heads is at least than <span class="process-math">\(7,500\text{.}\)</span>  There is a pause and then someone says “What? Are you out of your mind?”</div></li>
