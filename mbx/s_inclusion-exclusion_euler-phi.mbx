<title>The Euler <m>\phi</m> Function</title>
<p>
After reading the two previous sections, you're probably wondering why
we stated the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion in such an abstract
way, as in those examples <m>N(S)</m> depended only on the size of <m>S</m> and
not its contents. In this section, we produce an important example
where the value of <m>N(S)</m> <em>does</em> depend on <m>S</m>.
Nevertheless, we are able to make a reduction to obtain a useful end
result. In what follows, let <m>\posints</m> denote the set of positive
integers.
</p>

<p>
For a positive integer <m>n\ge2</m>, let
</p>
<me>
  \phi(n)=|\{m\in \posints: m\le n, \gcd(m,n)=1\}|.
</me>
<p>
This function is usually called the Euler <m>\phi</m> function or the Euler
totient function and has many connections to number theory. We won't
focus on the number-theoretic aspects here, only being able to compute
<m>\phi(n)</m> efficiently for any <m>n</m>.
</p>

<p>
For example, <m>\phi(12)=4</m> since the only numbers from <m>\{1,2,\dots,12\}</m>
that are relatively prime to <m>12</m> are <m>1</m>, <m>5</m>, <m>7</m> and <m>11</m>. As a
second example, <m>\phi(9)=6</m> since <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>4</m>, <m>5</m>, <m>7</m> and <m>8</m> are
relatively prime to <m>9</m>. On the other hand, <m>\phi(p)=p-1</m> when <m>p</m> is
a prime. Suppose you were asked to compute <m>\phi(321974)</m>. How
would you proceed?
</p>

<p>
In <xref ref="ch_induction" autoname="yes" /> we discussed a recursive procedure for
determining the greatest common divisor of two integers, and we wrote
a code for accomplishing this task. Let's assume that we have a
function declared as follows:
</p>

<p>
\begin{tt}
int gcd(int m, int n);
\end{tt}
</p>

<p>
that returns the greatest common divisor of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
</p>

<p>
Then we can calculate <m>\phi(n)</m> with this code snippet:
</p>

<p>
\begingroup
\parindent0pt
\begin{tt}
answer = 1;
</p>

<p>
for (m = 2; m <lt /> n; m++) \{<br />
\mbox{}  if (gcd(m,n) == 1) \{<br />
\mbox{}  answer++;<br />
\mbox{}  \}<br />
\}
</p>

<p>
return(answer);
\end{tt}
\endgroup
</p>

<p>
A program called <c>phi.c</c> using the code snippet above answers
almost immediately that <m>\phi(321974) = 147744</m>.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in just under two minutes the
program reported that
</p>
<me>
  \phi(319572943) = 319524480.
</me>
<p>
So how could we find <m>\phi(1369122257328767073)</m>?
</p>

<p>
Clearly, the program is useless to tackle this beast! It not only
iterates <m>n-2</m> times but also invokes a recursion during each
iteration. Fortunately, Inclusion-Exclusion comes to the rescue.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_eulerphi">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n\ge2</m> be a positive integer and suppose that
<m>n</m> has <m>m</m> distinct prime factors: <m>p_1</m>, <m>p_2,\dots,p_m</m>.
Then
</p>
<men xml:id="eq_eulerphi" >
  \phi(n) = n\prod_{i = 1}^{m}\frac{p_i-1}{p_i}.
</men>
</statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
We present the argument when <m>m=3</m>. The full result
is an easy extension.
</p>

<p>
Our argument requires the following elementary proposition
whose proof we leave as an exercise.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop_num-divisible">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n\ge2</m>, <m>k\ge1</m>, and let <m>p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k</m> be distinct primes each
of which divide <m>n</m> evenly (without remainder).
Then the number of integers from <m>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m> which are
divisble by each of these <m>k</m> primes is
</p>
<me>
  \frac{n}{p_1p_2\dots p_k}.
</me>
</statement>
</proposition>

<p>
Then Inclusion-Exclusion yields:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  \phi(n) \amp = n -\left(\frac{n}{p_1}+\frac{n}{p_2}+\frac{n}{p_3}\right) +
  \left(\frac{n}{p_1p_2}+\frac{n}{p_1p_3}+\frac{n}{p_2p_3}\right)-\frac{n}{p_1p_2p_3}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = n \frac{p_1p_2p_3 -(p_2p_3+p_1p_3+p_1p_2)+
      (p_3+p_2+p_1) - 1}{p_1p_2p_3}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =n \frac{p_1-1}{p_1}\frac{p_2-1}{p_2}\frac{p_3-1}{p_3}.</mrow>
</md>
</proof>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Maple reports that
</p>
<me>
  1369122257328767073 = (3)^3(11)(19)^4(31)^2(6067)^2
</me>
<p>
is the factorization of <m>1369122257328767073</m> into primes.
It follows that
</p>
<me>
  \phi(1369122257328767073) = 1369122257328767073
\,\,\frac{2}{3}\,\frac{10}{11}\,\frac{18}{19}\,\frac{30}{31}\,\frac{6066}{6067}.
</me>
<p>
Thus Maple quickly reports that
</p>
<me>
  \phi(1369122257328767073) =760615484618973600.

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Amanda and Bruce receive the same challenge from their professor, namely
to find <m>\phi(n)</m> when
</p>
<md>
  <mrow>  n  = \amp 31484972786199768889479107860964368171543984609017931</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp   39001922159851668531040708539722329324902813359241016</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp   93211209710523.</mrow>
</md>
<p>
However the Professor also tells Amanda that <m>n=p_1p_2</m> is the product
of two large primes where
</p>
<me>
  p_1 = 470287785858076441566723507866751092927015824834881906763507
</me>
<p>
and
</p>
<me>
  p_2 = 669483106578092405936560831017556154622901950048903016651289.
</me>
<p>
Is this information of any special value to Amanda? Does it really make
her job any easier than Bruce's? Would it level the playing field
if the professor told Bruce that <m>n</m> was the product of two primes?
