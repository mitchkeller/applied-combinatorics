<div class="para">For example, we could define a graph <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> with vertex set <span class="process-math">\(V=\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span> and edge set <span class="process-math">\(E=\{\{a,b\},\{c,d\},\{a,d\}\}\text{.}\)</span> Notice that no edge is incident to <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> which is perfectly permissible based on our definition. It is quite common to identify a graph with a visualization in which we draw a point for each vertex and a line connecting two vertices if they are adjacent. The graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> we’ve just defined is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_small_graph.html" title="Figure 5.1">Figure 5.1</a>. It’s important to remember that while a drawing of a graph is a helpful tool, it is not the same as the graph. We could draw <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> in any of several different ways without changing what it is as a graph.</div>
