<div class="para">When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X’s and O’s or one more X than there are O’s. Use this fact and <span class="process-math">\(t(X,O)\)</span> to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_polya_exercises.html#li-463" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
