<div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> is an interval order and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer, there may be many different ways to represent <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> using intervals with integer end points in <span class="process-math">\([n]\text{.}\)</span> But there is certainly a least <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> for which a representation can be found, and here we see that the representation is unique. The discussion will again make use of the notation for down sets and up sets that we introduced prior to the proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_dilworth.html" title="Theorem 6.17: Dilworth’s Theorem">Dilworth’s Theorem</a>. As a reminder, we repeat it here. For a poset <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> and a subset <span class="process-math">\(S\subset X\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(D(S) = \{y\in X:\)</span> there exists some <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(y\lt x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\}\text{.}\)</span> Also, let <span class="process-math">\(D[S]=D(S)\cup S\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(|S|=1\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(S=\{x\}\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(D(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D[x]\)</span> rather than <span class="process-math">\(D(\{x\})\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D[\{x\}]\text{.}\)</span> Dually, for a subset <span class="process-math">\(S\subseteq X\text{,}\)</span> we define <span class="process-math">\(U(S) = \{y\in X:\)</span> there exists some <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(y&gt;x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\}\text{.}\)</span> As before, set <span class="process-math">\(U[S]=U(S)\cup S\text{.}\)</span> And when <span class="process-math">\(S=\{x\}\text{,}\)</span> we just write <span class="process-math">\(U(x)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\{y\in X:x\lt y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\}\text{.}\)</span>
