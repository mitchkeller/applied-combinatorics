<div class="para">On the other hand, suppose we have scanned from every labeled vertex and there are still unlabeled vertices remaining, one of which is the sink.  Now we claim victory.  To see that we have won, we simply observe that if <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the set of labeled vertices, and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is the set of unlabeled vertices, then every edge <span class="process-math">\(e=(x,y)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\in U\)</span> is full, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(\phi(e)=c(e)\text{.}\)</span>  If this were not the case, then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> would qualify for a label with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as the first coordinate.  Also, note that <span class="process-math">\(\phi(y,x)=0\)</span> for every edge <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\in U\text{.}\)</span>  Regardless, we see that the capacity of the cut <span class="process-math">\(V=L\cup U\)</span> is exactly equal to the value of the current flow, so we have both a maximum flow and minimum cut providing a certificate of optimality.</div>
