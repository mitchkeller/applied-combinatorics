<div class="para">We begin this section with a motivational example.  Consider the connected graph on six vertices shown in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: fig-markovchain]</code>.  The first move is to choose a vertex at random and move there. Afterwards, we follow the following recursive procedures. If after <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> moves, you are at a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> neighbors, choose one of the neighbors at random, with each having probability <span class="process-math">\(1/d\)</span> and move there.  We then attempt to answer questions of the following flavor:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">For each vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(p_{x,m}\)</span> denote the probability that you are at vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> after <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> moves.  Does <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}p_{x,m}\)</span> exist and if so, how fast does the sequence converge to this limit?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How many moves must I make in order that the probability that I have walked on every edge in the graph is at least <span class="process-math">\(0.999\text{?}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ol>
