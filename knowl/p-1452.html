<div class="para">In this section, we introduce another useful variant of a graph. In a graph, the existence of an edge <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> can be used to model a connection between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that goes in both ways. However, sometimes such a model is insufficient. For instance, perhaps it is possible to fly from Atlanta directly to Fargo but not possible to fly from Fargo directly to Atlanta. In a graph representing the airline network, an edge between Atlanta and Fargo would lose the information that the flights only operate in one direction. To deal with this problem, we introduce a new discrete structure. A <dfn class="terminology">digraph</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is a pair <span class="process-math">\((V,E)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a vertex set and <span class="process-math">\(E\subset V\times V\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x\neq y\)</span> for every <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\in E\text{.}\)</span> We consider the pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> as a <dfn class="terminology">directed edge</dfn> from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Note that for distinct vertices <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> the ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((y,x)\)</span> are distinct, so the digraph may have one, both or neither of the directed edges <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((y,x)\text{.}\)</span> This is in contrast to graphs, where edges are sets, so <span class="process-math">\(\{x,y\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{y,x\}\)</span> are the same.</div>
