<div class="para">How many trees are there with vertex set <span class="process-math">\([n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}\text{?}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> be this number. For <span class="process-math">\(n=1\text{,}\)</span> there is clearly only one tree. Also, for <span class="process-math">\(n=2\text{,}\)</span> there is only one tree, which is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_2\text{.}\)</span> In determining <span class="process-math">\(T_3\text{,}\)</span> we finally have some work to do; however, thereâ€™s not much, since all trees on <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> vertices are isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_3\text{.}\)</span> Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(T_3=3\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">labeled trees</dfn> on <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> vertices, corresponding to which vertex is the one of degree <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n=4\text{,}\)</span> we can begin by counting the number of nonisomorphic trees and consider two cases depending on whether the tree has a vertex of degree <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> If there is a vertex of degree <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> the tree is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{1,3}\)</span> or it does not have a vertex of degree three, in which case it is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_4\text{,}\)</span> since there must be precisely two vertices of degree <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in such a graph. There are four labelings by <span class="process-math">\([4]\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{1,3}\)</span> (choose the vertex of degree three). How many labelings by <span class="process-math">\([4]\)</span> are there for <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_4\text{?}\)</span> There are <span class="process-math">\(C(4,2)\)</span> ways to choose the labels <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span> given to the vertices of degree <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and two ways to select one of the remaining labels to be made adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> ways to label <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_4\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\([4]\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(T_4=16\text{.}\)</span>
