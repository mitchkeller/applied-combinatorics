<div class="para">However, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring <span class="process-math">\(C_7\)</span> over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring <span class="process-math">\(C_9\text{.}\)</span> If we rotate coloring <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> clockwise by <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\text{,}\)</span> we obtain coloring <span class="process-math">\(C_3\text{.}\)</span> In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)</div>
