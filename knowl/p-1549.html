<div class="para">In this section, we outline the classic Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm for finding a maximum flow in a network. The algorithm begins with a linear order on the vertex set which establishes a notion of <dfn class="terminology">precedence</dfn>. Typically, the first vertex in this linear order is the source while the second is the sink. After that, the vertices can be listed in any order. In this book, we will use the following convention: the vertices will be labeled with capital letters of the English alphabet and the linear order will be <span class="process-math">\((S,T,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,\dots)\text{,}\)</span> which we will refer to as the <dfn class="terminology">pseudo-alphabetic order</dfn>. Of course, this convention only makes sense for networks with at most <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> vertices, but this limitation will not cramp our style. For real world problems, we take comfort in the fact that computers can deal quite easily with integer keys of just about any size.</div>
