<div class="para">A directed graph in which for each pair of vertices <span class="process-math">\(x,y\)</span> at most one of the directed edges <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((y,x)\)</span> between them is present is called an <dfn class="terminology">oriented graph</dfn>. The basic setup for a network flow problem begins with an oriented graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> called a <dfn class="terminology">network</dfn>, in which we have two special vertices called the <dfn class="terminology">source</dfn> and the <dfn class="terminology">sink</dfn>. We use the letter <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to denote the source, while the letter <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is used to denote the sink (terminus). All edges incident with the source are oriented away from the source, while all edges incident with the sink are oriented with the sink. Furthermore, on each edge, we have a non-negative <dfn class="terminology">capacity</dfn>, which functions as a constraint on how much can be transmitted via the edge. The capacity of the edge <span class="process-math">\(e=(x,y)\)</span> is denoted <span class="process-math">\(c(e)\)</span> or by <span class="process-math">\(c(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> In a computer program, the nodes of a network may be identified with integer keys, but in this text, we will typically use letters in labeling the nodes of a network. This helps to distinguish nodes from capacities in diagrams of networks. We illustrate a network in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_networkflow_network.html" title="Figure 13.1">FigureÂ 13.1</a>. The numbers associated with the edges are their capacities, so, for instance, <span class="process-math">\(c(E,B)=24\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c(A,T)=56\text{.}\)</span>
