<div class="para">Bob’s getting a bit of a sense of déjà vu after reading <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_networkflow_flowleqcut.html" title="Theorem 13.4">Theorem 13.4</a>. He remembers from <a href="ch_graphs.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Graph Theory">Chapter 5</a> that the maximum size of a clique in a graph is always at most the minimum number of colors required to properly color the graph. However, he also remembers that there are graphs without cliques of size three but with arbitrarily large chromatic number, so he’s not too hopeful that this theorem is going to help out much here. Yolanda chimes in with a reminder of <a href="ch_posets.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Partially Ordered Sets">Chapter 6</a>, where they learned that the maximum size of an antichain in a poset is equal to the minimum number of chains into which the ground set of the poset can be partitioned. Alice points out that Yolanda’s statement is still true if the words “chain” and “antichain” are swapped. This sparks some intense debate about whether the maximum value of a flow in a network must always be equal to the minimum capacity of a cut in that network. After a while, Carlos suggests that continuing to read might be the best idea for resolving their debate.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_networkflow_flows-cuts.html#remark-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
