  <title>Interval Orders</title>
  <p>When we discussed <xref ref="thm_dilworth" text="title" />, we commented that the algorithmic
    aspects would be deferred until later in the text. But there is one important class of orders
    for which the full solution is easy to obtain. </p>

  <p>A poset <m>\PXP</m> is called an <term>interval order</term><idx>
      <h>interval order</h>
    </idx> if there exists a function <m>I</m> assigning to each element <m>x\in
    X</m> a closed interval <m>I(x)=[a_x,b_x]</m> of the real line <m>\reals</m> so that for all <m>
    x</m>, <m>y\in X</m>, <m>x\lt y</m> in <m>P</m> if and only if <m>b_x\lt a_y</m> in <m>\reals</m>.
    We call <m>I</m> an <term>interval representation</term><idx>
      <h>interval representation</h>
    </idx> of <m>\bfP</m>, or just a <term>representation</term>
    for short. For brevity, whenever we say that <m>I</m> is a representation of an interval order <m>
    \PXP</m>, we will use the alternate notation <m>[a_x,b_x]</m> for the closed interval <m>I(x)</m>.
    Also, we let <m>|I(x)|</m> denote the <term>length</term> of the interval, <ie />, <m>
    |I(x)|=b_x-a_x</m>. Returning to the poset <m>\bfP_3</m>, the representation shown in <xref
      ref="fig_6ptintorder" /> shows that it is an interval order. </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_6ptintorder">
    <caption>An interval order and its representation</caption>
    <image width="70%" source="6ptintorder" />
  </figure>
  <p>Note that end points of intervals used in a representation need not be distinct. In fact,
    distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> from <m>X</m> may satisfy <m>I(x)=I(y)</m>. We even allow
    degenerate intervals, <ie />, those of the form <m>[a,a]</m>. On the other hand, a
    representation is said to be <term>distinguishing</term><idx>
      <h>interval representation</h>
      <h>distinguishing</h>
    </idx> if all intervals are non-degenerate and all end points are
    distinct. It is relatively easy to see that every interval order has a distinguishing
    representation. </p>
  <p>As we shall soon see, interval orders can be characterized succinctly in terms of forbidden
    subposets. Before stating this characterization, we need to introduce a bit more notation. By <m>
    \bfn</m> (for <m>n\geq 1</m> an integer), we mean the chain with <m>n</m> points. <notation>
      <usage>
        <m>\bfn</m>
      </usage>
      <description>chain with <m>n</m> points</description>
    </notation> More precisely, we take
    the ground set to be <m>\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}</m> with <m>i \lt j</m> in <m>\bfn</m> if and only if <m>i\lt
    j</m> in <m>\ints</m>. If <m>\PXP</m> and <m>\QYQ</m> are posets with <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>
    disjoint, then <m>\bfP+\bfQ</m><notation>
      <usage>
        <m>\bfP+\bfQ</m>
      </usage>
      <description>disjoint sum of posets</description>
    </notation> is the poset <m>\bfR=(X\cup
    Y,R)</m> where the partial order is given by <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>R</m> if and only if (a) <m>z,w\in
    X</m> and <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>P</m> or (b) <m>z,w\in Y</m> and <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>Q</m>.
    Thus, <m>\bfn+\bfm</m> consists of a chain with <m>n</m> points and a chain with <m>m</m> points
    and no comparabilities between them. In particular, <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m> can be viewed as a
    four-point poset with ground set <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m> and <m>a\lt b</m> and <m>c\lt d</m> as the
    only relations (other than those required to make the relation reflexive). </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_fishburn">
    <title>Fishburn's Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Let <m>\PXP</m> be a poset. Then <m>\bfP</m> is an interval order if and only if it
        excludes <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>. </p>
    </statement>

    <proof>
      <p>We show only that an interval order cannot contain a subposet isomorphic to <m>
        \bftwo+\bftwo</m>, deferring the proof in the other direction to the next section. Now
        suppose that <m>\PXP</m> is a poset, <m>\{x,y,z,w\}\subseteq X</m> and the subposet
        determined by these four points is isomorphic to <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>. We show that <m>\bfP</m>
        is not an interval order. Suppose to the contrary that <m>I</m> is an interval
        representation of <m>\bfP</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume that <m>x\lt y</m>
        and <m>z\lt w</m> in <m>P</m>. Thus <m>x\Vert w</m> and <m>z\Vert y</m> in <m>P</m>. Then <m>b_x\lt
        a_y</m> and <m>b_z \lt a_w</m> in <m>\reals</m> so that <m>a_w \le b_x \lt a_y \le b_z</m>,
        which is a contradiction. </p>
    </proof>
