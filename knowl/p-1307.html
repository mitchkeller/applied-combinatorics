<div class="para">For the spinner shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_spinner.html" title="Figure 10.1">Figure 10.1</a>, let <span class="process-math">\(X(i)=i^2\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is the number of the region. Then</div>

<div class="para">Note that <span class="process-math">\(109/8=13.625\text{.}\)</span> The significance of this quantity is captured in the following statement. If we record the result from the spinner <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> times in succession as <span class="process-math">\((i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n)\)</span> and Xing receives a prize worth <span class="process-math">\(i_j^2\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(j=1,2,\dots,n)\text{,}\)</span> then Xing should “expect” to receive a total prize worth <span class="process-math">\(109n/8=13.625n\text{.}\)</span>  Bob asks how this statement can possibly be correct, since <span class="process-math">\(13.625n\)</span> may not even be an integer, and any prize Xing receives will have integral value. Carlos goes on to explain that the concept of expected value provides a formal definition for what is meant by a fair game. If Xing pays <span class="process-math">\(13.625\)</span> cents to play the game and is then paid <span class="process-math">\(i^2\)</span> pennies where <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is the number of the region where the spinner stops, then the game is fair. If he pays less, he has an unfair advantage, and if he pays more, the game is biased against him.  Bob says “How can Xing pay <span class="process-math">\(13.625\)</span> pennies?” Brushing aside Bob’s question, Carlos says that one can prove that for every <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon &gt;0\text{,}\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(n_0\)</span> (which depends on <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) so that if <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;n_0\text{,}\)</span> then the probability that Xing’s total winnings minus <span class="process-math">\(13.625n\text{,}\)</span> divided by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is within <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(13.625\)</span> is at least <span class="process-math">\(1-\epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Carlos turns to Dave and explains politely that this statement gives a precise meaning of what is meant by “close” and “large”.</div>
