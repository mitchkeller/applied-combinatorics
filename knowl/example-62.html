<div class="para">Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>s, at least one <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and at most three <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don’t do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of <span class="process-math">\(10^8\)</span> eight-digit strings. Carlos isn’t convinced that’s the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on which there are no restrictions, a factor of <span class="process-math">\(e^{7x}\)</span> is introduced. To account for an even number of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>s, he uses <span class="process-math">\((e^x+e^{-x})/2\text{.}\)</span> For at least one <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> a factor of <span class="process-math">\(e^x-1\)</span> is required. Finally, <span class="process-math">\(1+x+x^2/2!+x^3/3!\)</span> accounts for the restriction of at most three <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>s. The exponential generating function for the number of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-digit passcodes is thus</div>

Alice points out that they don’t really need to find the coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(x^n/n!\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Instead, she suggests they use SageMath to just find the coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(x^8/8!\text{.}\)</span>
