<div class="para">After the basis step comes the <dfn class="terminology">inductive step</dfn>, in which we assume that <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> is true for <em class="emphasis">some</em> positive integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and prove that <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> is true. When doing this, we call <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> our <dfn class="terminology">inductive hypothesis</dfn>. In the inductive step, the most common mistake students make is starting with the entirety of <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> and manipulating it until they obtain a true statement. This is dangerous, as it is possible to start with something false and through valid algebraic steps, obtain a true statement. Instead, the best option is to work as with the basis step: if <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> is an equation or inequality, work on one side until you find a place to apply the inductive hypothesis and then continue until you obtain the other side. If the algebra gets tricky along the way, you can also work with the left-hand side of <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> and separately work with the right-hand side of <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\text{.}\)</span> If youâ€™re able to manipulate both sides to be in the same form, then you have shown they are equal and <span class="process-math">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> is true.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#s_induction_proofs-7" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
