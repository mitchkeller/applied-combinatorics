<div class="para">Bags of candy are being prepared to distribute to the children at a school. The types of candy available are chocolate bites, peanut butter cups, peppermint candies, and fruit chews. Each bag must contain at least two chocolate bites, an even number of peanut butter cups, and at most six peppermint candies. The fruit chews are available in four different flavorsâ€”lemon, orange, strawberry, and cherry. A bag of candy may contain at most two fruit chews, which may be of the same or different flavors. Beyond the number of pieces of each type of candy included, bags of candy are distinguished by using the flavors of the fruit chews included, not just the number. For example, a bag containing two orange fruit chews is different from a bag containing a cherry fruit chew and a strawberry fruit chew, even if the number of pieces of each other type of candy is the same.</div>

However, they know there will be fights if the bags do not all contain the same number of pieces of candy. What is the smallest number of pieces of candy they can include in the bags that ensures each student gets a different bag of candy containing the same number of pieces of candy?</div></li>
