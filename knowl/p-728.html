<div class="para">We are now ready for the proof. Let <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> be a poset and let <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> denote the width of <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\text{.}\)</span>  As in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_dualdilworth.html" title="Theorem 6.18: Dual of Dilworth’s Theorem">Theorem 6.18</a>, the Pigeon Hole Principle implies that we require at least <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> chains in any chain partition of <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\text{.}\)</span> To prove that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> suffice, we proceed by induction on <span class="process-math">\(|X|\text{,}\)</span> the result being trivial if <span class="process-math">\(|X|=1\text{.}\)</span> Assume validity for all posets with <span class="process-math">\(|X|\le k\)</span> and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> is a poset with <span class="process-math">\(|X|=k+1\text{.}\)</span> Without loss of generality, <span class="process-math">\(w&gt;1\text{;}\)</span> otherwise, the trivial partition <span class="process-math">\(X=C_1\)</span> satisfies the conclusion of the theorem. Furthermore, we observe that if <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a (nonempty) chain in <span class="process-math">\((X,P)\text{,}\)</span> then we may assume that the subposet <span class="process-math">\((X-C,P(X-C))\)</span> also has width <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> To see this, observe that the theorem holds for the subposet, so that if <span class="process-math">\(\width(X-C,P(X-C))=w'\lt w\text{,}\)</span> then we can partition <span class="process-math">\(X-C\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(X-C=C_1\cup C_2\cup\dots\cup C_{w'}\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(X=C\cup C_1\cup\dots\cup C_{w'}\)</span> is a partition into <span class="process-math">\(w'+1\)</span> chains. Since <span class="process-math">\(w'\lt w\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(w'+1\le w\text{,}\)</span> so we have a partition of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> into at most <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> chains. Since any partition of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> into chains must use at least <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> chains, this is exactly the partition we seek.</div>
