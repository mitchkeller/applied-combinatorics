<div class="para">We ask how many regions a family of <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> lines would determine, given these same restrictions on how the lines intersect. More generally, let <span class="process-math">\(r_n\)</span> denote the number of regions determined by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> lines. Evidently, <span class="process-math">\(r_1=2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_2=4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_3=7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_4=11\text{.}\)</span> Now it is easy to see that we have the recurrence <span class="process-math">\(r_{n+1} = r_n+n+1\text{.}\)</span> To see this, choose any one of the <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> lines and call it <span class="process-math">\(l\text{.}\)</span> Line <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> intersects each of the other lines and since no point in the plane belongs to three or more lines, the points where <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> intersects the other lines are distinct. Label them consecutively as <span class="process-math">\(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\text{.}\)</span> Then these points divide line <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> segments, two of which (first and last) are infinite. Each of these segments partitions one of the regions determined by the other <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> lines into two parts, meaning we have the <span class="process-math">\(r_n\)</span> regions determined by the other <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> lines and <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> new regions that <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> creates.</div>
