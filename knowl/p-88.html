<div class="para">Broadly, number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers. G.H. Hardy was a brilliant British mathematician who lived through both World Wars and conducted a large deal of number-theoretic research. He was also a pacifist who was happy that, from his perspective, his research was not “useful”. He wrote in his 1940 essay <span class="booktitle">A Mathematician’s Apology</span> “[n]o one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.”<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> Little did he know, the purest mathematical ideas of number theory would soon become indispensable for the cryptographic techniques that kept communications secure. Our subject here is not number theory, but we will see a few times where combinatorial techniques are of use in number theory.</div>
