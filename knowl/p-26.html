<div class="para">A unique feature of this book is a recurring cast of characters: Alice, Bob, Carlos, Dave, Xing, Yolanda and Zori. They are undergraduate students at Georgia Tech, they’re taking an 8:05am section of Math 3012: Applied Combinatorics, and they frequently go for coffee at the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center immediately after the class is over. They’ve become friends of sorts and you may find their conversations about Applied Combinatorics of interest, as they will may reveal subtleties behind topics currently being studied, reinforce connections with previously studied material or set the table for topics which will come later. Sometimes, these conversations will set aside in a clearly marked <em class="emphasis">Discussion</em> section, but they will also be sprinkled as brief remarks throughout the text.</div>
