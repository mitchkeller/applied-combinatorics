<div class="para">When the new point <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> enters <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> Assigner computes the values <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the largest integer for which there exists a chain <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> points in <span class="process-math">\(\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}\)</span> having <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> as its least element. Also, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the largest integer for which there exists a chain <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> points in <span class="process-math">\(\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}\)</span> having <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> as its largest element. Assigner then places <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in a set <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\text{,}\)</span> claiming that any two points in this set are incomparable.  To see that this claim is valid, consider the first moment where Builder has presented a new point <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> Assigner places <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\)</span> and there is already a point <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are comparable.</div>
