<div class="para">Now consider an alternative way to play the game.  Now Zori draws out a pair; the results are observed; and the marbles are set aside.  Next, she draws another pair from the remaining eight marbles, followed by a pair selected from the remaining six, etc.  Finally, the fifth pair is just the pair that remains after the fourth pair has been selected.  Now players may be free to wager on the outcome of any or all or just some of the five rounds.  Explain why either everyone should or no one should wager on the fifth round.  Accordingly, the last round is skipped and all marbles are returned to the jar and we start over again.</div>
