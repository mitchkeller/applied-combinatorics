<div class="para">Clearly, <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG_{t+1})=2\text{.}\)</span> Also, <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})\ge t\text{,}\)</span> since it contains <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> as a subgraph.  Furthermore, <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})\leq t+1\text{,}\)</span> since we can color <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> with colors from <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\dots,t\}\text{,}\)</span> use color <span class="process-math">\(t+1\)</span> on the independent set <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> and then assign color <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to the new vertex <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> We claim that in fact <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})=t+1\text{.}\)</span> Suppose not. Then we must have <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})=t\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> be a proper coloring of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\text{.}\)</span> Without loss of generality, <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> uses the colors in <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\dots,t\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> assigns color <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span>  Then consider the nonempty set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of vertices in the copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> to which <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> assigns color <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> change the color on <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> so that it matches the color assigned to <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{,}\)</span> which cannot be <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is colored <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> What results is a proper coloring of the copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> with only <span class="process-math">\(t-1\)</span> colors since <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> are adjacent to the same vertices of the copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span> The contradiction shows that <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})=t+1\text{,}\)</span> as claimed.</div>
