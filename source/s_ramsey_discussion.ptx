    <p>Zori started the conversation with <q>Who in their right mind would trust their lives to an algorithm that used random methods?</q> Xing quickly responded <q>Everyone. At least everyone should. We routinely deal with probabilistic concepts, like getting run over by a bus when crossing the street or having a piano fall on our head. The general public is much more comfortable with notions of probability, even though they may never know the formal definition of a probability space.  I for one am completely comfortable taking an airline flight if I can be assured that the probability of a disaster is less than <m>10^{-20}</m>.</q>

    <p>Dave wasn't biting on this topic. Instead he offered <q>You have to be struck by the statements that it appears difficult to construct objects which you can prove exist in abundance. I wonder why this is so.</q> Alice said <q>We all find your brain to be a totally random thing, sometimes making sense but often not.</q> There was laughter or at least some snickering. But after a bit, Carlos said <q>There's something fundamental here. Maybe one could prove that there are easily stated theorems which only have long proofs.</q> Bob blurted <q>That doens't make any sense.</q> Zori saw an opportunity where a client would, at considerable expense, commission her to solve a problem (at least better than the competition) that was readily understood but somehow difficult in the end. She knew about the class <m>\cgN\cgP</m> but maybe there were even bigger challenges (and bigger paychecks) out there.
