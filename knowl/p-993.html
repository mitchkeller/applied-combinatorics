<div class="para">Before proceeding to an additional example, let’s take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with at least one <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and at least one <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we can count all ternary strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and/or a <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> If a ternary string lacks a <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> we’re counting all strings made up of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>s and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>s, so there are <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> strings. Similarly for lacking a <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> However, if we subtract <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 2^n\text{,}\)</span> then we’ve subtracted the strings that lack both a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> <em class="emphasis">and</em> a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> twice. A ternary string that has no <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>s and no <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>s consists only of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>s. There is a single ternary string of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain <span class="process-math">\(3^n-2\cdot 2^n+1\)</span> in another way.</div>
