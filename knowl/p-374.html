<div class="para">Bob was beginning to understand proofs by induction, so he tried to prove that <span class="process-math">\(f(n)=2n+1\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\ge1\)</span> by induction. For the base step, he noted that <span class="process-math">\(f(1)= 3=2\cdot1+1\text{,}\)</span> so all is ok to this point.  For the inductive step, he assumed that <span class="process-math">\(f(k)=2k+1\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\ge1\)</span> and then tried to prove that <span class="process-math">\(f(k+1)=2(k+1)+1\text{.}\)</span> If this step could be completed, then the proof by induction would be done.</div>
