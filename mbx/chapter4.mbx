<title>Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients</title><introduction>
<p>
Much of combinatorial mathematics can be reduced to the study of
strings, as they form the basis of all written human communications.
Also, strings are the way humans communicate with computers, as well
as the way one computer communicates with another. As we shall see,
sets and binomial coefficients are topics that fall under the string
umbrella. So it makes sense to begin our in-depth study of
combinatorics with strings.
