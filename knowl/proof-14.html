<div class="para">Suppose the theorem fails and let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be the least positive integer for which there exists a graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices so that each vertex in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> has at least <span class="process-math">\(\lceil n/2\rceil\)</span> neighbors, yet there is no hamiltonian cycle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, <span class="process-math">\(n\ge4\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now let <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> be the largest integer for which <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> has a path <span class="process-math">\(P=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_t)\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> vertices. Clearly all neighbors of both <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_t\)</span> appear on this path. By the pigeon hole principle, there is some integer <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1\le i\lt t\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(x_1x_{i+1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_{i}x_t\)</span> are edges in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> However, this implies that</div>

<div class="para">is a cycle of length <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> In turn, this requires <span class="process-math">\(\lceil n/2\rceil \lt t\lt n\text{.}\)</span> But if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is any vertex not on the cycle, then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must have a neighbor on <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> has a path on <span class="process-math">\(t+1\)</span> vertices.
