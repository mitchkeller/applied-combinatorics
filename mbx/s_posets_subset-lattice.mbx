        <p>When <m>X</m> is a finite set, the family of all subsets of <m>X</m>, partially ordered by inclusion, forms a <term>subset lattice</term><idx><h>lattice</h><h>subset</h></idx><idx><h>lattice</h></idx><fn>A <term>lattice</term> is a special type of poset. You do not have to concern yourself with the definition and can safely replace <q>lattice</q> with <q>poset</q> as you read this chapter.</fn>. We illustrate this in <xref ref="fig_4cube"  /> where we show the lattice of all subsets of <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>. In this figure, note that we are representing sets by bit strings, and we have further abbreviated the notation by writing strings without commas and parentheses.

        <p>For a positive integer <m>t</m>, we let <m>\bftwo^t</m> denote the subset lattice consisting of all subsets of <m>\{1,2,\dots,t\}</m> ordered by inclusion. Some elementary properties of this poset are:
                  <ol>
            <li><p>The height is <m>t+1</m> and all maximal chains have exactly
            <m>t+1</m> points.</p></li>
            <li><p>The size of the poset <m>\bftwo^t</m> is <m>2^t</m> and the elements are partitioned into ranks (antichains) <m>A_0, A_1,\dots, A_t</m> with <m>|A_i|=\binom{t}{i}</m> for each <m>i=0,1,\dots,t</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The maximum size of a rank in the subset lattice occurs in the middle, <ie /> if <m>s=\lfloor t/2\rfloor</m>, then the largest binomial coefficient in the sequence <m>\binom{t}{0}, \binom{t}{1},\binom{t}{2},\dots,\binom{t}{t}</m> is <m>\binom{t}{s}</m>.  Note that when <m>t</m> is odd, there are two ranks of maximum size, but when <m>t</m> is even, there is only one.</p></li>

        <title>Sperner's Theorem</title>
        <p>For the width of the subset lattice, we have the following classic result of Sperner.
        </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm_sperner">
            <title>Sperner's Theorem</title>
            <statement>
                <p>For each <m>t\ge1</m>, the width of the subset lattice <m>\bftwo^t</m> is the maximum size of a rank, <ie />,
                <me>
                    \width(\bftwo^t)=\binom{t}{\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\rfloor}
                </me>
                </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
                <p>The width of the poset <m>\bftwo^t</m> is at least <m>C(t,\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\rfloor)</m> since the set of all <m>\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\rfloor</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\dots,t\}</m> is an antichain. We now show that the width of <m>\bftwo^t</m> is at most <m>C(t,\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\rfloor)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>Let <m>w</m> be the width of <m>\bftwo^t</m> and let <m>\{S_1,S_2,\dots, S_w\}</m> be an antichain of size <m>w</m> in this poset, <ie />, each <m>S_i</m> is a subset of <m>\{1,2,\dots,t\}</m> and if <m>1\le i\lt j\le w</m>, then <m>S_i\nsubseteq S_j</m> and <m>S_j\nsubseteq S_i</m>.
                </p>

                <p>For each <m>i</m>, consider the set <m>\cgS_i</m> of all maximal chains which pass through <m>S_i</m>. It is easy to see that if <m>|S_i|=k_i</m>, then <m>|\cgS_i|=k_i!(t-k_i)!</m>. This follows from the observation that to form such a maximum chain beginning with <m>S_i</m> as an intermediate point, you delete the elements of <m>S_i</m> one at a time to form the sets of the lower part of the chain. Also, to form the upper part of the chain, you add the elements not in <m>S_i</m> one at a time.
                </p>

                <p>Note further that if <m>1\le i \lt j\le w</m>, then <m>\cgS_i\cap \cgS_j =\emptyset</m>, for if there was a maximum chain belonging to both <m>\cgS_i</m> and <m>\cgS_j</m>, then it would imply that one of <m>S_i</m> and <m>S_j</m> is a subset of the other.
                </p>

                <p>Altogether, there are exactly <m>t!</m> maximum chains in <m>\bftwo^t</m>. This implies that
                <me>
                    \sum_{i=1}^{w} k_i!(t-k_i)!\le t!.
                </me>
                This implies that
                <me>
                    \sum_{i=1}^{w}\frac{k_i!(t-k_i)!}{t!}=
                    \sum_{i=1}^{w}\frac{1}{\binom{t}{k_i}}\le 1.
                </me>
                It follows that
                <me>
                    \sum_{i=1}^{i=w}\frac{1}{\binom{t}{\lceil\frac{t}{2}\rceil}}\le 1
                </me>
                Thus
                <me>
                    w\le \binom{t}{\lceil\frac{t}{2}\rceil}.
                </me>
                </p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
