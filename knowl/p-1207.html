<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(C(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n\)</span> be the generating function for the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{c_n\colon n\geq 0\}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(c_n\)</span> is the number of RUBOTs with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> leaves. (We take <span class="process-math">\(c_0=0\)</span> for convenience.) Then we can see from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_rubots.html" title="Figure 9.26">Figure 9.26</a> that <span class="process-math">\(C(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 5x^4 + \cdots\text{.}\)</span> But what are the remaining coefficients? Let’s see how we can break a RUBOT with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> leaves down into a combination of two smaller RUBOTs to see if we can express <span class="process-math">\(c_n\)</span> in terms of some <span class="process-math">\(c_k\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(k\lt n\text{.}\)</span> When we look at a RUBOT with <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 2\)</span> leaves, we notice that the root vertex must have two children. Those children can be viewed as root nodes of smaller RUBOTs, say the left child roots a RUBOT with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> leaves, meaning that the right child roots a RUBOT with <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> leaves. Since there are <span class="process-math">\(c_k\)</span> possible sub-RUBOTs for the left child and <span class="process-math">\(c_{n-k}\)</span> sub-RUBOTs for the right child, there are a total of <span class="process-math">\(c_kc_{n-k}\)</span> RUBOTs in which the root’s left child has <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> leaves on its sub-RUBOT. We can do this for any <span class="process-math">\(k=1,2,\dots,n-1\text{,}\)</span> giving us that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig_rubots.html">
\begin{equation*}
c_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_kc_{n-k}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">(This is valid since <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 2\text{.}\)</span>)  Since <span class="process-math">\(c_0=0\text{,}\)</span> we can actually write this as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig_rubots.html">
\begin{equation*}
c_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_kc_{n-k}.
