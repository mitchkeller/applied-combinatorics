<div class="para">Now let <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4 = \pi_1\pi_2\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4(1) = 3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4(2)=2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4(3)=1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4(4)=4\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\pi_4=(13)(2)(4)\text{,}\)</span> which we called <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> earlier. Itâ€™s important to note that <span class="process-math">\(\pi_1\pi_2\neq \pi_2\pi_1\text{,}\)</span> which hopefully does not surprise you, since function composition is not in general commutative. To further illustrate the lack of commutativity in permutation groups, pick up a book (Not this one! You need to keep reading directions here.) so that cover is up and the spine is to the left. First, flip the book over from left to right. Then rotate it <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\)</span> clockwise. Where is the spine? Now return the book to the cover-up, spine-left position. Rotate the book <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\)</span> clockwise and then flip it over from left to right. Where is the spine this time?</div>
