    <title>Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>Now we move on to induction, the powerful twin of recursion.
    </p>

    <p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. Consider the following mathematical statements, each of which involve <m>n</m>:
    <ol>
        <li><m>2n+7 = 13</m>.</li>
        <li><m>3n-5=9</m>.</li>
        <li><m>n^2-5n+9=3</m>.</li>
        <li><m>8n-3 \lt  48</m>.</li>
        <li><m>8n-3 > 0</m>.</li>
        <li><m>(n+3)(n+2) =n^2+5n+6</m>.</li>
        <li><m>n^2 -6n + 13 \ge 0</m>.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Such statements are called <term>open statements</term><idx><h>statement</h><h>open</h></idx>. Open statements can be considered as <term>equations</term>, <ie />, statements that are valid for certain values of <m>n</m>. Statement<nbsp />1 is valid only when <m>n=3</m>. Statement<nbsp />2 is never valid, <ie />, it has no solutions among the positive integers. Statement<nbsp />3 has exactly two solutions, and Statement<nbsp />4 has six solutions. On the other hand, Statements<nbsp />5, 6 and<nbsp />7 are valid for all positive integers.
    </p>

    <p>At this point, you are probably scratching your head, thinking that this discussion is trivial. But let's consider some statements that are a bit more complex.
                  <ol>
        <li><p>The sum of the first <m>n</m> positive integers is <m>n(n+1)/2</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The sum of the first <m>n</m> odd positive integers is <m>n^2</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p><m>n^n \ge  n! + 4,000,000,000n2^n</m>  when <m>n\ge 14</m>.</p></li>
    
                  </ol>
                </p>

    <p>How can we establish the validity of such statements, provided of course that they are actually true? The starting point for providing an answer is the following property:
    </p>

    <principle xml:id="princ_math-induction">
        <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
        <idx><h>induction</h><h>principle of mathematical</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>S_n</m> be an open statement involving a positive integer <m>n</m>. If <m>S_1</m> is true, and if for each positive integer <m>k</m>, assuming that the statement <m>S_k</m> is true implies that the statement <m>S_{k+1}</m> is true, then <m>S_n</m> is true for every positive integer<nbsp /><m>n</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </principle>

    <p>With a little thought, you should see that the <xref ref="princ_math-induction" text="title" /> is logically equivalent to the <xref ref="princ_well-order" text="title" />. If you haven't already done so, now might be a good time to look over <xref ref="app_background"  /> on background material.
