<div class="para">Bob says that he’s really getting to like this combinatorial mathematics stuff. The concrete nature of the subject is appealing.  But he’s not sure that he understands the algorithmic component.  Sometimes he sees how one might actually compute the answer to a problem—provided he had access to a powerful computer. At other times, it seems that a computational approach might be out of reach, even with the world’s best and fastest computers at ready access. Carlos says it can be much worse than that. There are easily stateable problems that no one knows how to attack even if all the world’s computational power is used in concert. And there’s nothing on the horizon that will change that. In fact, build faster computers and you just change the threshold for what is computable. There will still be easily understood problems that will remain unresolved.</div>
