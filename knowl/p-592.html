<div class="para">First, let’s look at how <span class="process-math">\(\prufer(\bfT)\)</span> behaves. What numbers actually appear in the Prüfer code? The numbers that appear in the Prüfer code are the labels of the <em class="emphasis">nonleaf</em> vertices of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\text{.}\)</span> The label of a leaf simply cannot appear, since we always record the label of the <em class="emphasis">neighbor</em> of the leaf we are deleting, and the only way we would delete the neighbor of a leaf is if that neighbor were also a leaf, which can only happen if <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\cong\bfK_2\text{,}\)</span> in which case <span class="process-math">\(\prufer(\bfT)\)</span> simply returns the empty string. Thus if <span class="process-math">\(I\subset [n]\)</span> is the set of symbols that appear in <span class="process-math">\(\prufer(\bfT)\text{,}\)</span> the labels of the leaves of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> are precisely the elements of <span class="process-math">\([n]-I\text{.}\)</span>
