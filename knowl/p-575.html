<div class="para">Interest in the Four Color Problem languished until 1877, when the British mathematician Arthur Cayley wrote a letter to the Royal Society asking if the problem had been resolved. This brought the problem to the attention of many more people, and the first “proof” of the Four Color Theorem, due to Alfred Bray Kempe, was completed in 1878 and published a year later. It took <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> years before Percy John Heawood found a flaw in the proof but was able to salvage enough of it to show that every planar graph has chromatic number at most five. In 1880, Peter Guthrie Tait, a British physicist best known for his book <span class="booktitle">Treatise on Natural Philosophy</span> with Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), made an announcement that suggested he had a proof of the Four Color Theorem utilizing hamiltonian cycles in certain planar graphs. However, consistent with the way Tait approached some conjectures in the mathematical theory of knots, it appears that he subsequently realized around 1883 that he could not prove that the hamiltonian cycles he was using actually existed and so Tait likely only believed he had a proof of the Four Color Theorem for a short time, if at all. However, it would take until 1946 to find a counterexample to the conjecture Tait had used in his attempt to prove the Four Color Theorem.</div>
