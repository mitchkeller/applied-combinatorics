<div class="para">We have already encountered the case <span class="process-math">\(n=5\)</span> in the midst of working on <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_genfunction_apples.html" title="Example 8.4">Example 8.4</a>, but there we appealed to calculus. Let’s take a look at this from the perspective of just counting. The generating function <span class="process-math">\(1/(1-x) = 1+x+x^2+\cdots\)</span> encodes the sequence for the number of ways to distribute <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> apples to <em class="emphasis">one</em> child. There’s only one way to do that task: give the lucky kid all the apples. Multiplying together a bunch of copies of <span class="process-math">\(1/(1-x)\)</span> then serves to increase the number of children to whom the apples are being distributed, and since each power series being multiplied starts with <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we are in the situation where the number of apples each child receives must be <em class="emphasis">nonnegative</em>. This is therefore a problem from <a href="s_strings_bin-coeff.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.5: The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients">Section 2.5</a>. We have <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> children and the coefficient on <span class="process-math">\(x^k\)</span> is the number of ways of distributing <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> apples to them. This requires <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> artificial apples, so we distribute <span class="process-math">\(k+n\)</span> apples, which determine <span class="process-math">\(k+n-1\)</span> gaps and we must choose <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> of them as the locations for dividers. Therefore, we can conclude that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/exa_genfunction_apples.html ./knowl/s_strings_bin-coeff.html">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{(1-x)^n} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{k+n-1}{n-1}x^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{k+n-1}{n}x^k\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">It’s possible to arrive at this conclusion using techniques from calculus, but there are a lot of factorials and <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span>s to monitor, so this combinatorial approach may be less error prone!</div>
