<div class="para">Graph theory is an area of mathematics that has found many applications in a variety of disciplines. Throughout this text, we will encounter a number of them. However, graph theory traces its origins to a problem in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) nearly three centuries ago. The river Pregel passes through the city, and there are two large islands in the middle of the channel. These islands were connected to the mainland by seven bridges as indicated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_bridges.html" title="Figure 5.12">Figure 5.12</a>. It is said that the citizens of Königsberg often wondered if it was possible for one to leave his home, walk through the city in such a way that he crossed each bridge precisely one time, and end up at home again. Leonhard Euler settled this problem in 1736 by using graph theory in the form of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_eulerian.html" title="Theorem 5.13">Theorem 5.13</a>.</div>
