<div class="para">With the aid of this observation, the calculation of the variance of the random variable <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> which counts the number of successes becomes a trivial calculation. But in fact, the entire treatment we have outlined here is just a small part of a more complex subject which can be treated more elegantly and ultimately much more compactlyâ€”provided you first develop additional background material on families of random variables. For this we will refer you to suitable probability and statistics texts, such as those given in our references.</div>
