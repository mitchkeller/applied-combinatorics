<div class="para">Let’s return now to the subject of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_radiostations.html" title="Example 1.5">Example 1.5</a>, assigning frequencies to radio stations so that they don’t interfere. The first thing that we will need to do is to turn the map of radio stations into a suitable graph, which should be pretty natural at this juncture. We define a graph <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> in which <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is the set of radio stations and <span class="process-math">\(xy\in E\)</span> if and only if radio station <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and radio station <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are within <span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> miles of each other. With this as our model, then we need to assign different frequencies to two stations if their corresponding vertices are joined by an edge. This leads us to our next topic, coloring graphs.</div>
