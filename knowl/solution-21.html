<div class="para">Even if you’ve not studied differential equations, you should recognize that this question is really just asking us to find a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(0)=2\)</span> and its derivative is three times itself. Let’s ignore the <dfn class="terminology">initial condition</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(f(0)=2\)</span> for the moment and focus on the meat of the problem. What function, when you take its derivative, changes only by being multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(3\text{?}\)</span> You should quickly think of the function <span class="process-math">\(e^{3x}\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(D(e^{3x}) = 3e^{3x}\text{,}\)</span> which has exactly the property we desire. Of course, for any constant <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(ce^{3x}\)</span> also satisfies this property, and this gives us the hook we need in order to satisfy our initial condition. We have <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = ce^{3x}\)</span> and want to find <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(0)=2\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\(f(0) = c\cdot 1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(c=2\)</span> does the trick and the solution to this very simple differential equation is <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 2e^{3x}\text{.}\)</span>
