<div class="para">It is important to note that Assigner does not need to know the value <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in advance. For example, Builder may have in mind that ultimately the value of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> will be <span class="process-math">\(300\text{,}\)</span> but this information does not impact Assigner’s strategy.</div> <div class="para">When the new point <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> enters <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> Assigner computes the values <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the largest integer for which there exists a chain <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> points in <span class="process-math">\(\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}\)</span> having <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> as its least element. Also, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the largest integer for which there exists a chain <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> points in <span class="process-math">\(\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}\)</span> having <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> as its largest element. Assigner then places <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in a set <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\text{,}\)</span> claiming that any two points in this set are incomparable.  To see that this claim is valid, consider the first moment where Builder has presented a new point <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> Assigner places <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\)</span> and there is already a point <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are comparable.</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> was presented, there was at that moment in time a chain <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> points having <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as its least element. Also, there was a chain <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> points having <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as its greatest element.</div> <div class="para">Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(y&gt;x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Then we can add <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> to form a chain of <span class="process-math">\(r+1\)</span> points having <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as its least element.  This would imply that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not assigned in <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(y\lt x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> then we may add <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(D'\)</span> to form a chain of <span class="process-math">\(s+1\)</span> points having <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as its greatest element. Again, this would imply that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not assigned to <span class="process-math">\(A(r,s)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">So Assigner has indeed devised a good strategy for partitioning <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> into antichains, but how many antichains has she used?  This is just asking how many ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\((i,j)\)</span> of positive integers are there subject to the restriction that <span class="process-math">\(i+j-1\le h\text{.}\)</span> And we learned how to solve this kind of question in <a href="ch_strings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients">Chapter 2</a>.  The answer of course is <span class="process-math">\(\binom{h+1}{2}\text{.}\)</span>
