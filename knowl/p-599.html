<div class="para">On the surface, the problem of determining if a graph is hamiltonian looks similar to that of determining if the graph is eulerian. Both call for a sequence of vertices in which each pair of consecutive vertices is joined by an edge. Of course, each problem has an additional requirement on yes certificates. However, justifying a negative answer to the question of whether a graph is hamiltonian is not straightforward. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_graphs_dirac.html" title="Theorem 5.18">Theorem 5.18</a> only gives a way to confirm that a graph <em class="emphasis">is</em> hamiltonian; there are many nonhamiltonian graphs that do not satisfy its hypothesis. At this time, no one knows how to efficiently justify a negative answer—at least not in the general case.</div>
