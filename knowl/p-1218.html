<div class="para">This finally got Bobâ€™s attention, since it <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">s</code> seems to be taking a relatively constant time to run even as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> increases, while <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code> seems to be taking about 10 times as long to run for each increase of 5 in the value of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> As a final test, they execute the SageMath code below, which calculates <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">s(100)</code> almost instantly. On the other hand, it seems like getting a refill on their coffee would be a good way to pass the time waiting on <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r(40)</code>.</div>
