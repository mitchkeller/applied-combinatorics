Now assume that for some <span class="process-math">\(t\ge3\text{,}\)</span> we have determined the graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(n_t\)</span> vertices.

</div> <div class="para">To see that <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG_{t+1})=2\text{,}\)</span> it will suffice to argue that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\)</span> contains no triangle (<span class="process-math">\(\bfK_3\)</span>). Since <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> is triangle-free, any triangle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\)</span> must contain a vertex of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Since none of the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> are adjacent, any triangle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\)</span> contains only one point of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Since each vertex of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is adjacent to at most one vertex of any fixed copy of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(y\in I\)</span> is part of a triangle, the other two vertices must come from distinct copies of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span> However, vertices in different copies of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> are not adjacent, so <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG_{t+1})=2\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})\ge t\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_{t+1}\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})\le t+1\)</span> since we may use <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> colors on the copies of <span class="process-math">\(\bfG_t\)</span> and a new color on the independent set <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> To see that <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG_{t+1})=t+1\text{,}\)</span> observe that if we use only <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> colors, then by the generalized Pigeon Hole Principle, there is an <span class="process-math">\(n_t\)</span>-element subset of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> in which all vertices have the same color.
