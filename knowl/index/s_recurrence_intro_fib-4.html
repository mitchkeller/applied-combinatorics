<div class="para">Letâ€™s see how we can get a recurrence from this story. Let <span class="process-math">\(f_n\)</span> denote the number of pairs rabbits on the island in month <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(f_1 = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f_2 = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f_3=2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_4=3\)</span> from our account above. How can we compute <span class="process-math">\(f_n\text{?}\)</span> Well, in the <span class="process-math">\(n^\text{th}\)</span> month we have all the pairs of rabbits that were there during the previous month, which is <span class="process-math">\(f_{n-1}\text{;}\)</span> however, some of those pairs of rabbits also reproduce during this month. Only the ones who were born prior to the previous month are able to reproduce during month <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> so there are <span class="process-math">\(f_{n-2}\)</span> pairs of rabbits who are able to reproduce, and each produces a new pair of rabbits. Thus, we have that the number of rabbits in month <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 3\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f_1=f_2=1\text{.}\)</span> The sequence of numbers <span class="process-math">\(\{f_n\colon n\geq 0\}\)</span> (we take <span class="process-math">\(f_0=0\text{,}\)</span> which satisfies our recurrence) is known as the <dfn class="terminology">Fibonacci sequence</dfn> after Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician who lived from about 1170 until about 1250. The terms <span class="process-math">\(f_0,f_1,\dots,f_{20}\)</span> of the Fibonacci sequence are</div>
