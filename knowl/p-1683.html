<div class="para">Western music is generally based on a system of <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> equally-spaced <dfn class="terminology">notes</dfn>. Although these notes are usually named by letters of the alphabet (with modifiers), for our purposes it will suffice to number them as <span class="process-math">\(0,1,\dots,11\text{.}\)</span> These notes are arranged into <dfn class="terminology">octaves</dfn> so that the next pitch after <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> is again named <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and the pitch before <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is named <span class="process-math">\(11\text{.}\)</span> For this reason, we may consider the system of notes to correspond to the integers modulo <span class="process-math">\(12\text{.}\)</span> With these definitions, a <dfn class="terminology">scale</dfn> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1,\dots,11\}\)</span> arranged in increasing order. A <dfn class="terminology">transposition of a scale</dfn> is a uniform transformation that replaces each note <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> of the scale by <span class="process-math">\(x+a\pmod{12}\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Musicians consider two scales to be equivalent if one is a transposition of the other. Since a scale is a subset, no regard is paid to which note starts the scale, either. The question we investigate in this section is “How many nonequivalent scales are there consisting of precisely <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> notes?”</div>
