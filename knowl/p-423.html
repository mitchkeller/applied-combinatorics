<div class="para">The first of the three problems sounds easy, and it is. You just consider the numbers in the set one by one and test to see if any of them is <span class="process-math">\(83,172\text{.}\)</span> You can stop if you ever find this number and report that the answer is yes. If you return a no answer, then you will have to have read every number in the list. Either way, you halt with a correct answer to the question having done at most <span class="process-math">\(10,000\)</span> tests, and even the most modest netbook can do this in a heartbeat.  And if the list is expanded to <span class="process-math">\(1,000,000\)</span> integers, all at most a billion, you can still do it easily. More generally, if you’re given a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> numbers and an integer <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with the question “Is <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> a member of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{?}\)</span>”, you can answer this question in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> steps, with each step an operation of testing a number in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to see if it is exactly equal to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> So the running time of this algorithm is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> with the constant depending on the amount of time it takes a computer to perform the basic operation of asking whether a particular integer is equal to the target value.</div>
