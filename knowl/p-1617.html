<div class="para">Let’s see how following this process for the flow in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flowapplications_poset_network_flow2.html" title="Figure 14.10">Figure 14.10</a> leads to a chain partition. If we start with <span class="process-math">\(x_1'\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\((x_1',x_3'')\)</span> is full, so we place <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> in chain <span class="process-math">\(C_1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x_3'\)</span> has no flow leaving it, there are no greater elements to add to the chain. However, <span class="process-math">\(x_1''\)</span> has flow in from <span class="process-math">\(x_2'\text{,}\)</span> so we add <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C_1\text{.}\)</span> We now see that <span class="process-math">\(x_2''\)</span> has flow in from <span class="process-math">\(x_7'\text{,}\)</span> so now <span class="process-math">\(C_1=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_7\}\text{.}\)</span> Vertex <span class="process-math">\(x_7''\)</span> has no flow into it, so the building of the first chain stops. The first vertex we haven’t placed into a chain is <span class="process-math">\(x_4\text{,}\)</span> so we note that <span class="process-math">\((x_4',x_5'')\)</span> is full, placing <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span> in chain <span class="process-math">\(C_2\text{.}\)</span> We then look from <span class="process-math">\(x_5'\)</span> and see no flow leaving. However, there is flow into <span class="process-math">\(x_4''\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x_6'\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x_6\)</span> is added to <span class="process-math">\(C_2\text{.}\)</span> There is no flow out of <span class="process-math">\(x_6''\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(C_2=\{x_4,x_5,x_6\}\text{.}\)</span> Now the first point not in a chain is <span class="process-math">\(x_8\text{,}\)</span> so we use the flow from <span class="process-math">\(x_8'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x_9''\)</span> to place <span class="process-math">\(x_8\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_9\)</span> in chain <span class="process-math">\(C_3\text{.}\)</span> Again, no flow out of <span class="process-math">\(x_9'\text{,}\)</span> so we look to <span class="process-math">\(x_8''\text{,}\)</span> which is receiving flow from <span class="process-math">\(x_{10}''\text{.}\)</span> Adding <span class="process-math">\(x_{10}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C_3\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(C_3=\{x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}\text{,}\)</span> and since every point is now in a chain, we may stop.</div>
