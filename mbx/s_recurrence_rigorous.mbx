<title>Formalizing our approach to recurrence equations</title>


<introduction>
<p>
So far, our approach to solving recurrence equations has been based on
intuition, and we've not given a lot of explanation for why the
solutions we've given have been the general solution. In this section,
we endeavor to remedy this. Some familiarity with the language of
linear algebra will be useful for the remainder of this section, but
it is not essential.
</p>

<p>
Our techniques for solving recurrence equations have their roots in a
fundamentally important concept in mathematics, the notion of a vector
space. Recall that a vector space<fn> To be more complete, we
  should say that we are talking about a vector space over the field
  of real numbers, but in our course, these are the only kind of
  vector spaces we will consider.  For this reason, we just use the
  short phrase <q>vector space</q>.</fn> consists of a set <m>V</m> of elements
called <em>vectors</em>; in addition, there is a binary operation
called <em>addition</em> with the sum of vectors <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> denoted
by <m>x+y</m>; furthermore, there is an operation called <em>scalar
multiplication</em> or <em>scalar product</em> which combines a scalar
(real number) <m>\alpha</m> and a vector <m>x</m> to form a product denoted
<m>\alpha x</m>. These operations satisfy the following properties.
</p>

<ol>
<li><m>x+y=y+x</m> for every <m>x,y,\in V</m>.</li>
<li><m>x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z</m>, for every <m>x,y,z\in V</m>.</li>
<li>There is a vector called <em>zero</em> and denoted <m>0</m> so that
  <m>x+0=x</m> for every <m>x\in V</m>. <em>Note:</em> We are again overloading
  an operator and using the symbol <m>0</m> for something other than a
  number.</li>
<li>For every element <m>x\in V</m>, there is an element <m>y\in V</m>, called
  the <em>additive inverse</em> of <m>x</m> and denoted <m>-x</m> so that
  <m>x+(-x)=0</m>.  This property enables us to define
  <em>subtraction</em>, i.e., <m>x-y= x+(-y)</m>.</li>
<li><m>1x=x</m> for every <m>x\in X</m>.</li>
<li><m>\alpha(\beta x) = (\alpha\beta)x</m>, for every
  <m>\alpha,\beta\in\reals</m> and every <m>x\in V</m>.</li>
<li><m>\alpha(x+y)=\alpha x + \alpha y</m> for every <m>\alpha\in\reals</m>
  and every <m>x,y\in V</m>.</li>
<li><m>(\alpha +\beta) x = \alpha x + \beta x</m>, for every
  <m>\alpha,\beta\in\reals</m> and every <m>x\in V</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When <m>V</m> is a vector space, a function <m>\phi:V\rightarrow V</m> is called
an <em>linear operator</em>, or just <em>operator</em> for short, when
<m>\phi(x+y)=\phi(x)+\phi(y)</m> and <m>\phi(\alpha x)=\alpha\phi(x)</m>. When
<m>\phi:V\rightarrow V</m> is an operator, it is customary to write <m>\phi
x</m> rather than <m>\phi(x)</m>, saving a set of parentheses. The set of all
operators over a vector space <m>V</m> is itself a vector space with
addition defined by <m>(\phi+\rho)x = \phi x +\rho x</m> and scalar
multiplication by <m>(\alpha\phi)x=\alpha(\phi x)</m>.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we focus on the real vector space <m>V</m> consisting of
all functions of the form <m>f:\ints\rightarrow\reals</m>. Addition is
defined by <m>(f+g)(n)= f(n)+g(n)</m> and scalar multiplication is defined
by <m>(\alpha f)(n)=\alpha(f(n))</m>.

<title>The Principal Theorem</title>
<p>
Here is the basic theorem about solving recurrence equations (stated
in terms of advancement operator equations)<mdash />and while we won't prove
the full result, we will provide enough of an outline where it
shouldn't be too difficult to fill in the missing details.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_advance">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>k</m> be a positive integer <m>k</m>, and let <m>c_0,c_1,\dots,c_k</m> be
constants with <m>c_0,c_k\neq 0</m>. Then the set <m>W</m> of all solutions to the
homogeneous linear equation
</p>
<men>
  (c_0A^{k}+ c_1A^{k-1} + c_2A^{k-2} + \dots+c_k)f = 0
</men>
<p>
is a <m>k</m>-dimensional subspace of <m>V</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
The conclusion that the set <m>W</m> of all solutions is a subspace
of <m>V</m> is immediate, since
</p>
<me>
  p(A)(f+g)=p(A)f+p(A)g\quad\text{ and } \quad p(a)(\alpha f)=\alpha p(A)(f).
</me>
<p>
What takes a bit of work is to show that <m>W</m> is a
<m>k</m>-dimensional subspace. But once this is done,
then to solve the advancement operator
equation given in the form of <xref ref="thm_advance" autoname="yes" />, it
suffices to find a <em>basis</em> for the vector space <m>W</m>.
Every solution is just a linear combination of basis vectors.
In the next several sections, we outline
how this goal can be achieved.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="s_recurrence_rigorous_start">
<title>The Starting Case</title>
<p>
The development proceeds by induction (surprise!) with
the case <m>k=1</m> being the base case. In this case, we study
a simple equation of the form <m>(c_0A+c_1)f=0</m>. Dividing by
<m>c_0</m> and rewriting using subtraction rather than addition, it
is clear that we are just talking about an equation of the form
<m>(A-r)f=0</m> where <m>r\neq0</m>.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lem_base">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>r\neq0</m>,and let <m>f</m> be a solution to the operator equation <m>(A-r)f=0</m>,
Then let <m>c=f(0)</m>. Then <m>f(n)=cr^n</m> for every
<m>n\in \ints</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
We first show that <m>f(n)=cr^n</m> for every
<m>n\ge0</m>, by induction on <m>n</m>. The base case is trivial since
<m>c=f(0) = cr^0</m>. Now suppose that <m>f(k)=cr^k</m> for some non-negative
integer <m>k</m>. Then <m>(A-r)f=0</m> implies that <m>f(k+1)-rf(k)=0</m>, i.e.,
</p>
<me>
  f(k+1)=rf(k)= rcr^k=cr^{k+1}.
</me>
<p>
A very similar argument shows that <m>f(-n) = cr^{-n}</m> for
every <m>n\le0</m>.
</p>
</proof>

<lemma xml:id="lem_particular">
<statement>
<p>
Consider a nonhomogeneous operator equation of the form
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_nonhomogeneous" >
  p(A)f= (c_0A^{k}+ c_1A^{k-1} + c_2A^{k-2} + \dots+c_k)f = g,
</men>
<p>
with <m>c_0,c_k\neq0</m>,
and let <m>W</m> be the subspace of <m>V</m> consisting of all solutions
to the corresponding homogeneous equation
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_homogeneous" >
  p(A)f=(c_0A^{k}+ c_1A^{k-1} + c_2A^{k-2} + \dots+c_k)f = 0.
</men>
<p>
If <m>f_0</m> is a solution to <xref ref="eqn_nonhomogeneous" autoname="yes" />, then every
solution <m>f</m> to <xref ref="eqn_nonhomogeneous" autoname="yes" /> has the form
<m>f=f_0+f_1</m> where <m>f_1\in W</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>f</m> be a solution of <xref ref="eqn_nonhomogeneous" autoname="yes" />, and let
<m>f_1=f-f_0</m>.
Then
</p>
<me>
  p(A)f_1 = p(A)(f-f_0)=p(A)f-p(A)f_0=g-g=0.
</me>
<p>
This implies that <m>f_1\in W</m> and that <m>f=f_0+f_1</m> so that all
solutions to <xref ref="eqn_nonhomogeneous" autoname="yes" /> do in fact have the desired
form.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
Using the preceding two results, we can now provide an outline of the
inductive step in the proof of <xref ref="thm_advance" autoname="yes" />, at least in the
case where the polyomial in the advancement operator has distinct
roots.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the following advancement operator equation
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_distinct" >
  p(A)f=(A-r_1)(A-r_2)\dots(A-r_k)f=0.
</men>
<p>
with <m>r_1,r_2,\dots,r_k</m> distinct non-zero constants.
Then every solution
to <xref ref="eqn_distinct" autoname="yes" /> has the form
</p>
<me>
  f(n)=c_1r_1^n+c_2 r_2^n+c_3r_3^n+\dots+c_kr_k^n.
</me>
</statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
The case <m>k=1</m> is <xref ref="lem_base">Lemma</xref>. Now
suppose we have established the theorem for some positive integer
<m>m</m> and consider the case <m>k=m+1</m>. Rewrite <xref ref="eqn_distinct" autoname="yes" /> as
</p>
<me>
  (A-r_1)(A-r_2)\dots(A-r_m)[(A-r_{m+1})f]=0.
</me>
<p>
By the inductive hypothesis, it follows that if <m>f</m> is a solution to
<xref ref="eqn_distinct" autoname="yes" />, then <m>f</m> is also a solution to the
nonhomogeneous equation
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_distinct2" >
  (A-r_{m+1})f=d_1r_1^n+d_2r_2^n+\dots+d_mr_m^n.
</men>
<p>
To find a particular solution <m>f_0</m> to <xref ref="eqn_distinct2" autoname="yes" />,
we look for a solution having the form
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_distinct3" >
  f_0(n)= c_1 r_1^n+c_2 r_2^n+\dots+c_m r_m^n.
</men>
<p>
On the other hand, a simple calculation shows that for each
<m>i=1,2,\dots,m</m>, we have
</p>
<me>
  (A-r_{m+1})c_i r_i^n=c_i r_i^{n+1}-r_{m+1}c_i r_i^n=c_i (r_i-r_{m+1})r_i^n,
</me>
<p>
so it suffices to choose <m>c_i</m> so that <m>c_i(r_i-r_{m+1})=d_i</m>, for each
<m>i=1,2,\dots,m</m>. This can be done since <m>r_{m+1}</m> is distinct from
<m>r_i</m> for <m>i=1,2,\dots m</m>.
</p>

<p>
So now we have a particular solution <m>f_0(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i
  r_i^n</m>. Next we consider the corresponding homogeneous equation
<m>(A-r_{m+1})f=0</m>. The general solution to this equation has the
form <m>f_1(n)=c_{m+1}r_{m+1}^n</m>. It follows that every solution to
the original equation has the form
</p>
<me>
  f(n)=f_0(n)+f_1(n) = c_1r_1^n+c_2r_2^n+\dots+c_m r_m^n+cr_{m+1}^n,
</me>
<p>
which is exactly what we want!
</p>
</proof>

<title>Repeated Roots</title>
<p>
It is straightforward to modify the proof given in the preceding
section to obtain the following result. We leave the details as an
exercise.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lem_rr">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>k\ge1</m> and consider the equation
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_rr" >
  (A-r)^kf=0.
</men>
<p>
Then the general solution to <xref ref="eqn_rr" autoname="yes" /> has the following form
</p>
<men xml:id="eqn_solutionrr" >
  f(n)=c_1r^n+c_2nr^n+c_3n^2r^n+c_4n^3r^n+\dots+c_kn^{k-1}r^n.
</men>
</statement>

<subsection xml:id="s_recurrence_rigorous_general">
<title>The General Case</title>
<p>
Combining the results in the preceding sections, we can quickly write
the general solution of any homogeneous equation of the form <m>p(A)f=0</m>
<em>provided</em> we can factor the polynomial <m>p(A)</m>. Note that in
general, this solution takes us into the field of <em>complex
numbers</em>, since the roots of a polynomial with real coefficients are
sometimes complex numbers<mdash />with non-zero imaginary parts.
</p>

<p>
We close this section with one more example which illustrates how
quickly we can read off the general solution of a homogeneous
advancement operator equation <m>p(A)f=0</m>, provided that <m>p(A)</m> is
factored.
