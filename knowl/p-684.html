<div class="para">The set of real numbers comes equipped with a natural total order. For example, <span class="process-math">\(1\lt 7/5\lt \sqrt{2}\lt \pi\)</span> in this order. But in this chapter, we will be interested primarily with partial orders that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> linear orders. Also, we note that special care must be taken when discussing partial orders on ground sets whose elements are real numbers. For the poset shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_17ptposet.html" title="Figure 6.5">Figure 6.5</a>, note that <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> is less than <span class="process-math">\(8\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> are incomparable.  Best not to tell your parents that you’ve learned that under certain circumstances, <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> can be less than <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> and that you may be able to say which of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> is larger than the other. The subtlety may be lost in the heated discussion certain to follow.</div>
