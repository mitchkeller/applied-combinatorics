    <title>Applying the Local Lemma</title>
    <p>The list of applications of the Local Lemma has been growing steadily, as has the interest in how the lemma can be applied algorithmically, <ie />, in a constructive setting. But here we present one of the early applications to Ramsey theory<mdash />estimating the Ramsey number <m>(R,3,n)</m>. <idx><h>Ramsey number</h></idx> Recall that we have the basic inequality <m>R(3,n)\le \binom{n+1}{3}</m> from <xref ref="thm_graphramsey"  />, and it is natural to turn to the probabilistic method to look for good lower bounds.  But a few minutes thought shows that there are challenges to this approach.
    </p>

    <p>First, let's try a direct computation. Suppose we try a random graph on <m>t</m> vertices with edge probability <m>p</m>. So we would want no triangles, and that would say we need <m>t^3p^3=1</m>, <ie />, <m>p=1/t</m>. Then we would want no independent sets of size <m>n</m>, which would require <m>n^te^{-pn^2}=1</m>, <ie />, <m>t\ln n=pn^2</m>, so we can't even make <m>t</m> larger than <m>n</m>. That's not helpful.
    </p>

    <p>We can do a bit better by allowing some triangles and then removing one point from each, as was done in the proof for <xref ref="thm_girth"  />. Along these lines, we would set <m>t^3p^3=t</m>, <ie />, <m>p=t^{-2/3}</m>. And the calculation now yields the lower bound <m>R(3,n)\ge n^{6/5}/\ln^{-3/5} n</m>, so even the exponent of <m>n</m> is different from the upper bound.
    </p>

    <p>So which one is right, or is the answer somewhere in between?  In a classic 1961 paper, Erd&#337;s used a very clever application of the probabilistic method to show the existence of a graph from which a good lower bound could be extracted. His technique yielded the lower bound <m>R(3,n)\ge n^2/\ln^2 n</m>, so the two on the exponent of <m>n</m> is correct.
    </p>

    <p>Here we will use the Lov&#xe1;sz Local Lemma<idx><h>Lov&#xe1;sz Local Lemma</h></idx> to obtain this same lower bound in a much more direct manner. We consider a random graph on <m>t</m> vertices with edge probability <m>p</m>.  For each <m>3</m>-element subset <m>S</m>, we have the event <m>E_S</m> which is true when <m>S</m> forms a triangle. For each <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m>, we have the event <m>E_T</m> which is true when <m>T</m> is an independent set. In the discussion to follow, we abuse notation slightly and refer to events <m>E_S</m> and <m>E_T</m> as just <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, respectively. Note that the probability of <m>S</m> is <m>p^3</m> for each <m>3</m>-element set <m>S</m>, while the probability of <m>T</m> is <m>q=(1-p)^{C(n,2)}\sim e^{-pn^2/2}</m> for each <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m>.
    </p>

    <p>When we apply the Local Lemma, we will set <m>x=x(S)</m> to be <m>e^2p^3</m>, for each <m>3</m>-element set <m>S</m>. And we will set <m>y=Y(T)=q^{1/2}\sim e^{-pn^2/4}</m>. It will be clear in a moment where we got those values.
    </p>

    <p>Furthermore, the neighborhood of an event consists of all sets in the family which have two or more elements in common.  So the neighborhood of a <m>3</m>-element set <m>S</m> consists of <m>3(t-3)</m> other <m>3</m>-element sets and <m>C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-3,n-2)</m> sets of size<nbsp /><m>n</m>.  Similarly, the neighborhood of an <m>n</m>-element set <m>T</m> consists of <m>C(n,3)+ (t-n)C(n,2)</m> sets of size <m>3</m> and <m>\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}C(n,i) C(t-n,n-i)</m> other sets of size<nbsp /><m>n</m>. So the basic inequalities we need to satisfy are:
    <md>
        <mrow>  p^3 \le \amp  x(1-x)^{3(t-3)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}</mrow>
        <mrow>  q \le \amp  y(1-x)^{C(n,3)+(t-n)C(n,2)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}</mrow>
    </md>
    Next, we assume that <m>n^{3/2}\lt t\lt n^2</m> and then make the usual approximations, ignoring smaller order terms and multiplicative constants, to see that these inequalities can be considered in the following simplified form:
    <md>
        <mrow>  p^3 \le \amp  x(1-x)^{t}(1-y)^{t^n}</mrow>
        <mrow>  q \le \amp  y(1-x)^{tn^2}(1-y)^{t^n}</mrow>
    </md>
    A moments reflection makes it clear that we want to keep the terms involving <m>(1-y)</m> relatively large, <ie />, at least <m>1/e</m>. This will certainly be true if we keep <m>t^n\le 1/y</m>. This is equivalent to <m>n\ln t\le pn^2</m>, or <m>\ln t\le pn</m>.
    </p>

    <p>Similarly, we want to keep the term <m>(1-x)^{t}</m> relatively large, so we keep <m>t\le 1/x</m>, <ie />, <m>t\le 1/p^3</m>. On the other hand, we want only to keep the term <m>(1-x)^{tn^2}\sim e^{-xtn^2}</m> at least as large as <m>y</m>. This is equivalent to keeping <m>p\le xt</m>, and since <m>x\sim p^3</m>, this can be rewritten as <m>p^{-1}\le t^{1/2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>Now we have our marching orders. We just set <m>\ln t=pn</m> and <m>p^{-1}=t^{1/2}</m>. After substituting, we get <m>t= n^2/\ln^2t</m> and since <m>\ln t=\ln n</m> (at least within the kind of approximations we are using), we get the desired result <m>t=n^2/\ln^2n</m>.
