<div class="para">Carlos leaves Bob to try to figure out a better approach. He realizes that starting from the zero flow, he’d only need the augmenting paths <span class="process-math">\((S,A,T)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((S,B,T)\text{,}\)</span> each with <span class="process-math">\(\delta=M\)</span> to quickly get the maximum flow. However, he’s not sure why an algorithm should find those augmenting paths to be preferable. About this time, Dave wanders by and mumbles something about the better augmenting paths using only two edges, while Carlos’ two evil augmenting paths each used three. Bob thinks that maybe Dave’s onto something, so he decides to go back to reading his textbook.</div>
