            <p>Matt is designing a website authentication system. He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers, and symbols. However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears. He decides that valid passwords for his system will begin with three letters (uppercase and lowercase both allowed), followed by two digits, followed by one of <m>10</m> symbols, followed by two uppercase letters, followed by a digit, followed by one of <m>10</m> symbols. How many different passwords are there for his website system? How does this compare to the total number of strings of length <m>10</m> made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters, decimal digits, and <m>10</m> symbols?</p>

                factors as if the <q>multiplication</q> operation in question were
                not necessarily associative. For example, there is one way to
                parenthesize a product of two factors <m>(a_1a_2)</m>, there are two
                ways to parenthesize a product of three factors (<m>(a_1(a_2a_3))</m>
                and <m>((a_1a_2)a_3)</m>), and there are five ways to parenthesize a
                product of four factors:
                <me>
                    (a_1(a_2(a_3a_4))),
                    (a_1((a_2a_3)a_4)), ((a_1a_2)(a_3a_4)),
                    ((a_1(a_2a_3))a_4), (((a_1a_2)a_3)a_4).
                </me>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Sequences of <m>n</m> <m>1</m>'s and <m>n</m> <m>-1</m>'s in which the sum of
                the first <m>i</m> terms is nonnegative for all <m>i</m>.</p></li>

                <me>
                    111\qquad 112\qquad 113\qquad 122\qquad 123.
