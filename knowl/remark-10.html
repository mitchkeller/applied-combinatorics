<div class="para">The ever alert Alice notes that the proof given above for Dilworth’s theorem does not seem to provide an efficient algorithm for finding the width <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> of a poset, much less a partition of the poset into <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> chains. Bob has yet to figure out why listing all the subsets of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a bad idea. Carlos is sitting quietly listening to their bickering, but finally, he says that a skilled programmer can devise an algorithm from the proof. Students are encouraged to discuss this dilemma—but rest assured that we will return to this issue later in the text.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_posets_dilworth.html#remark-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
