<div class="para">It is interesting to note that each female’s prospects improve over time, i.e., once she has a suitor, things only get better. Conversely, each male’s prospects deteriorate over time. Regardless, we assert that the resulting matching is stable. To see this, suppose that it is unstable and choose males <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b'\text{,}\)</span> females <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is matched to <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> prefers <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> prefers <span class="process-math">\(b'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> The algorithm requires that male <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> start at the top of his list and work his way down. Since he eventually lands on <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span>’s door step, and he prefers <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> it implies that once upon a time, he was actually at <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span>’s door, and she sent him away. This means that at that exact moment, she had a male in hand that she prefers to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Since her holdings only improve with time, it means that when the matching is finalized, female <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a mate <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> that she prefers to <span class="process-math">\(b'\text{.}\)</span>
