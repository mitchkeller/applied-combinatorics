<li>Draw a graph with <m>8</m> vertices, all of odd degree, that does not
  contain a path of length <m>3</m> or explain why such a graph does not
  exist.</li>
<li>Draw a graph with <m>6</m> vertices having degrees <m>5</m>, <m>4</m>, <m>4</m>,
  <m>2</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>1</m> or explain why such a graph does not exist.</li>
<li>For the next Olympic Winter Games, the organizers wish to expand
  the number of teams competing in curling. They wish to have <m>14</m>
  teams enter, divided into two pools of seven teams each. Right now,
  they're thinking of requiring that in preliminary play each team
  will play seven games against distinct opponents. Five of the
  opponents will come from their own pool and two of the opponents
  will come from the other pool. They're having trouble setting up
  such a schedule, so they've come to you. By using an appropriate
  graph-theoretic model, either argue that they cannot use their
  current plan or devise a way for them to do so.</li>
<li>For this exercise, consider the graph <m>\bfG</m> in
  <xref ref="fig_graphs_subgraphs_ex" autoname="yes" />.
<ol>
<li>Let <m>V_1=\{g,j,c,h,e,f\}</m> and <m>E_1=\{ge,jg,ch,ef\}</m>. Is
    <m>(V_1,E_1)</m> a subgraph of <m>\bfG</m>?</li>
<li>Let <m>V_2=\{g,j,c,h,e,f\}</m> and <m>E_2=\{ge,jg,ch,ef,cj\}</m>. Is
    <m>(V_2,E_2)</m> a subgraph of <m>\bfG</m>?</li>
<li>Let <m>V_3=\{a,d,c,h,b\}</m> and <m>E_3=\{ch,ac,ad,bc\}</m>. Is
    <m>(V_3,E_3)</m> an induced subgraph of <m>\bfG</m>?</li>
<li>Draw the subgraph of <m>\bfG</m> induced by <m>\{g,j,d,a,c,i\}</m>.</li>
<li>Draw the subgraph of <m>\bfG</m> induced by <m>\{c,h,f,i,j\}</m>.</li>
<li>Draw a subgraph of <m>\bfG</m> having vertex set <m>\{e,f,b,c,h,j\}</m>
    that is <em>not</em> an induced subgraph.</li>
<li>Draw a spanning subgraph of <m>\bfG</m> with exactly <m>10</m> edges.</li>

<li>A pharmaceutical manufacturer is building a new warehouse to
  store its supply of <m>10</m> chemicals it uses in production. However,
  some of the chemicals cannot be stored in the same room due to undesirable
  reactions that will occur. The matrix below has a <m>1</m> in position
  <m>(i,j)</m> if and only if chemical <m>i</m> and chemical <m>j</m> cannot be
  stored in the same room. Develop an appropriate graph theoretic
  model and determine the smallest number of rooms into which they can
  divide their warehouse so that they can safely store all <m>10</m>
  chemicals in the warehouse.

<li>A school is preparing the schedule of classes for the next
  academic year. They are concerned about scheduling calculus,
  physics, English, statistics, economics, chemistry, and German
  classes, planning to offer a single section of each one. Below are
  the lists of courses that each of six students must take in order to
  successfully graduate. Determine the smallest number of class
  periods that can be used to schedule these courses if each student
  can take at most one course per class period. Explain why fewer
  class periods cannot be used.

<ol>
<li>From

    you know that choosing a bad ordering of the vertices of a graph
    can lead to the First Fit coloring algorithm producing a coloring
    that is far from optimal. However, you can use this algorithm to
    prove a bound on the chromatic number. Show that if every vertex

<li>Construct the labeled tree <m>\bfT</m> with Pr&#xfc;fer code (using
  commas to separate symbols in the string, since we have labels
  greater than <m>9</m>) <m>10,1,7,4,3,4,10,2,2,8</m>.</li>
<li>(Challenge problem) When <m>\GVE</m> is a graph, let <m>\Delta(\bfG)</m> denote the maximum
  degree in <m>\bfG</m>.  Prove <b>Brooks' Theorem</b>:  If <m>\bfG</m> is connected and
  <m>\Delta(\bfG)=k</m>, then
  <m>\chi(\bfG)\le k+1</m>.  Furthermore, equality holds if and only if
  (a)<nbsp /><m>k=2</m> and <m>\bfG</m> is an odd cycle, or (b)<nbsp /><m>k\neq2</m> and <m>\bfG=\bfK_{k+1}</m>.
  Hint: It's clear that <m>\chi(\bfG)\le k+1</m> (in fact, this was
  already assigned as an exercise). Assume that <m>\chi(\bfG)=k+1</m>
  but that neither conclusion (a) or (b) holds.  Take a spanning tree of
  <m>\bfG</m> and an appropriate ordering of the
  vertices, with two leaves of the tree coming first.  Then show that a 
  First Fit coloring of the graph will only use <m>k</m> colors.</li>
