<div class="para">“Well”, said Bob, “that takes care of the strange sequence, but I still don’t see any difference between induction and recursion.” Dave couldn’t keep quiet “No one does.” Xing thought differently and said “In many programming languages, you try to avoid recursion, preferring to use loops instead. Otherwise, you wind up overloading the stack. As just one example, you can compute the greatest common divisor <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> as well as find <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(d=am+bn\)</span> using a loop—with very little storage. The recursive approach discussed previously, with the inherent back tracking at the end, isn’t really necessary.” Yolanda was impressed with Xing’s extensive programming experience and knowledge, but Alice was less so.</div>
