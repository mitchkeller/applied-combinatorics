We choose integers <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;s\text{,}\)</span> and it will eventually be clear how large they need to be in terms of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> We will then consider a random graph on vertex set <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\text{,}\)</span> and just as before, for each <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(1\le i\lt j\le n\text{,}\)</span> the probability that the pair <span class="process-math">\(ij\)</span> is an edge is <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> but now <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> will depend on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Of course, the probability that any given pair is an edge is completely independent of all other pairs.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#thm_girth-5-1" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>

<div class="para">Our first goal is to choose the values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> so that with high probability, a random graph does not have an independent set of size <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> You might think as a second goal, we would try to get a random graph without small cycles. But this goal is too restrictive. Instead, we just try to get a graph in which there are relatively few small cycles. In fact, we want the number of small cycles to be less than <span class="process-math">\(n/2\text{.}\)</span> Then we will remove one vertex from each small cycles, resulting in a graph with at least <span class="process-math">\(n/2\)</span> vertices, having no small cycles and no independent set of sizeÂ <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> The chromatic number of this graph is at least <span class="process-math">\(n/2s\text{,}\)</span> so we will want to have the inequality <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;2st\text{.}\)</span><div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#thm_girth-5-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
