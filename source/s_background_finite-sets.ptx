    <title>Finite Sets</title>
    <p>A set <m>X</m> is said to be <term>finite</term><idx><h>set</h><h>finite</h></idx> when either (1) <m>X=\emptyset</m>; or (2) there exists positive integer <m>n</m> and a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>.  When <m>X</m> is not finite, it is called <term>infinite</term><idx><h>set</h><h>infinite</h></idx>. For example, <m>\{a,\emptyset,(3,2),\posints\}</m> is a finite set as is <m>\posints\times\emptyset</m>. On the other hand, <m>\posints\times \{\emptyset\}</m> is infinite. Of course, <m>[n]</m> and <m>\bfn</m> are finite sets for every <m>n\in\posints</m>.
    </p>

    <proposition>
        <statement>
            <p>If <m>X</m> be a non-empty finite set, then there is a unique positive integer <m>n</m> for which there is a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>In some cases, it may take some effort to determine whether a set is finite or infinite. Here is a truly classic result.
    </p>

    <proposition>
        <statement>
            <p>The set <m>P</m> of primes is infinite.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <proof>
        <p>Suppose that the set <m>P</m> of primes is finite. It is non-empty since <m>2\in P</m>. Let <m>n</m> be the unique positive integer for which there exists a bijection <m>f:[n]\rightarrow P</m>. Then let
        <me>
            p=1+f(1)\times f(2)\times f(3)\times \dots\times f(n)
        </me>
        Then <m>p</m> is not divisible by any of the primes in <m>P</m> but is larger than any element of <m>P</m>.  Thus, either <m>p</m> is prime or there is a prime that does not belong to <m>P</m>. The contradiction completes the proof.
        </p>
    </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>Here's a famous example of a set where no one knows if the set is finite or not.
    </p>
    <conjecture>
        <statement>
            <p>
            It is conjectured that the following set is infinite:
            <me>
                T=\{n\in\posints:n \text{ and }  n+2 \text{ are both
                primes } \}.
            </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </conjecture>
    <p>This conjecture is known as the <em>Twin Primes Conjecture</em>.  Guaranteed <m>\text{A} ++</m> for any student who can settle it!
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="exe_sb">
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be finite sets. If there exists an injection <m>f:X\injection Y</m> and an injection <m>g:Y \injection X</m>, then there exists a bijection <m>h:X \bijection Y</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>When <m>X</m> is a finite non-empty set, the <term>cardinality</term><idx><h>cardinality</h></idx> of <m>X</m>, denoted <m>|X|</m> <notation><usage><m>|X|</m></usage><description>cardinality of set <m>X</m></description></notation>is the unique positive integer <m>n</m> for which there is a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>. Intuitively, <m>|X|</m> is the number of elements in <m>X</m>. For example,
    <me>
        |\{(6,2), (8,(4,\emptyset)), \{3,\{5\}\}\}|=3.
    </me>
        By convention, the cardinality of the empty set is taken to be zero, and we write <m>|\emptyset|=0</m>.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop_xy">
        <statement>
            <p>If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are finite non-empty sets, then <m>|X\times Y| =|X|\times |Y|</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </proposition>

        <p>We note that the statement in <xref ref="prop_xy"  /> is an example of <q>operator overloading</q>, a technique featured in several programming languages. Specifically, the times sign <m>\times</m> is used twice but has different meanings. As part of <m>X\times Y</m>, it denotes the cartesian product, while as part of <m>|X|\times |Y|</m>, it means ordinary multiplication of positive integers. Programming languages can keep track of the data types of variables and apply the correct interpretation of an operator like <m>\times</m> depending on the variables to which it is applied.
        </p>
        <p>We also have the following general form of <xref ref="prop_xy"  />:
        <me>
            |X_1\times X_2\times\dots\times X_n|=
            |X_1|\times |X_2|\times\dots\times |X_n|
        </me>
    </p>

    <theorem>
        <statement>
            <p>
               <ol>
                <li><p>There is a bijection between any two of the following
                infinite sets <m>\posints</m>, <m>\ints</m> and <m>\rats</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p>There is an injection from <m>\rats</m> to <m>\reals</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p>There is no surjection from <m>\rats</m> to <m>\reals</m>.</p></li>
               </ol>
