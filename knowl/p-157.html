<div class="para">To motivate the topic of this section, we consider another variant on the officer election problem from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_strings_officers.html" title="Example 2.7">Example 2.7</a>. Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the “first” seat on the executive council and her winning the “fourth” seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> students without any regard to order. We’ll return to this question after introducing our next concept.</div>
