<div class="para">Recall that a bipartite graph <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> is one in which the vertices can be properly colored using only two colors. It is clear that such a coloring then partitions <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> into two independent sets <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{,}\)</span> and so all the edges are between <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{.}\)</span> Bipartite graphs have many useful applications, particularly when we have two distinct types of objects and a relationship that makes sense only between objects of distinct types. For example, suppose that you have a set of workers and a set of jobs for the workers to do. We can consider the workers as the set <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and the jobs as <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> and add an edge from worker <span class="process-math">\(w\in V_1\)</span> to job <span class="process-math">\(j\in V_2\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is qualified to do <span class="process-math">\(j\text{.}\)</span><div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#s_flowapplications_bip-match-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
