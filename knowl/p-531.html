<div class="para">Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> does not contain an odd cycle. Note that we may assume that <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is connected, as each component may be colored individually. The <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(d(u,v)\)</span> between vertices <span class="process-math">\(u,v\in V\)</span> is the length of a shortest path from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and of course <span class="process-math">\(d(u,u) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Fix a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_0\in V\)</span> and define</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A = \{v\in V\colon d(u_0,v)\text{ is even}\}\qquad\text{and}\qquad B = \{v\in V\colon d(v_0,v)\text{ is odd}\}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We claim that coloring the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with color <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> with color <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is a proper coloring. suppose not. Then without loss of generality, there are vertices <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(xy\in E\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(d(v_0,x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d(v_0,y)\)</span> are both even. Let</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n=x
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_m= y

</div>
<div class="para">be shortest paths from <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively. If <span class="process-math">\(x_1\neq y_j\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(1\leq i\leq n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\leq j\leq m\text{,}\)</span> then since <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> are both even,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n=x,y=y_m,y_{m-1},\dots,y_2,y_1,v_0

</div>
<div class="para">is an odd cycle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> which is a contradiction. Thus, there must be <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x_i=y_j\text{,}\)</span> and we may take <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span> as large as possible. (That is, after <span class="process-math">\(x_i=y_j\text{,}\)</span> the two paths do not intersect again.) Thus,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x_i,x_{i+1},\dots,x_n = x,y=y_m,y_{m-1},\dots,y_j=x_i

<div class="para">is a cycle in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> How many vertices are there in this cycle? A quick count shows that it has</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n-(i-1)+m-(j-1)-1=n+m-(i+j)+1

</div>
<div class="para">vertices. We know that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are even, and notice that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> are either both even or both odd, since <span class="process-math">\(x_i = y_j\)</span> and the odd-subscripted vertices of our path belong to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> while those with even subscripts belong to <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(i+j\)</span> is even, so <span class="process-math">\(n+m-(i+j)+1\)</span> is odd, giving a contradiction.</div>
