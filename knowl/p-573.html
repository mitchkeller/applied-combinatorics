<div class="para">Could it possibly be true that <em class="emphasis">every</em> map could be colored with only four colors? He asked his brother Frederick Guthrie, who was a mathematics student at University College, London, about the problem, and Frederick eventually communicated the problem to Augustus de Morgan (of de Morganâ€™s laws fame), one of his teachers. It was in this way that one of the most famous (or infamous) problems, known for a century as the Four Color Problem and now the Four Color Theorem, in graph theory was born. De Morgan was very interested in the Four Color Problem, and communicated it to Sir William Rowan Hamilton, a prominent Irish mathematician and the one for whom hamiltonian cycles are named, but Hamilton did not find the problem interesting. Hamilton is one of the few people who considered the Four Color Problem but did not become captivated by it.</div>
