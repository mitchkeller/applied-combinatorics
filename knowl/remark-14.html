<div class="para">Bob says that if a fair coin is tossed <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> times, it is fairly likely that you will get exactly <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> heads and <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> tails. Dave is not so certain this is right. Carlos fires up his computer and in few second, he reports that the probability of getting exactly <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> heads when a fair coin is tossed <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> times is</div>

Xing is doing a modestly more complicated calculation, and he reports that you have a <span class="process-math">\(99\)</span>% chance that the number of heads is at least <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> and at most <span class="process-math">\(80\text{.}\)</span> Carlos adds that when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is very large, then it is increasingly certain that the number of heads in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> tosses will be close to <span class="process-math">\(n/2\text{.}\)</span> Dave asks what do you mean by close, and what do you mean by very large?</div>
