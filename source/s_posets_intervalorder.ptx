    <title>Interval Orders</title>
    <p>When we discussed <xref ref="thm_dilworth" text="title" />, we commented that the algorithmic aspects would be deferred until later in the text. But there is one important class of orders for which the full solution is easy to obtain.
    </p>

    <p>A poset <m>\PXP</m> is called an <term>interval order</term><idx><h>interval order</h></idx> if there exists a function <m>I</m> assigning to each element <m>x\in X</m> a closed interval <m>I(x)=[a_x,b_x]</m> of the real line <m>\reals</m> so that for all <m>x</m>, <m>y\in X</m>, <m>x\lt y</m> in <m>P</m> if and only if <m>b_x\lt a_y</m> in <m>\reals</m>. We call <m>I</m> an <term>interval representation</term><idx><h>interval representation</h></idx> of <m>\bfP</m>, or just a <term>representation</term> for short. For brevity, whenever we say that <m>I</m> is a representation of an interval order <m>\PXP</m>, we will use the alternate notation <m>[a_x,b_x]</m> for the closed interval <m>I(x)</m>. Also, we let <m>|I(x)|</m> denote the <term>length</term> of the interval, <ie />, <m>|I(x)|=b_x-a_x</m>. Returning to the poset <m>\bfP_3</m>, the representation shown in <xref ref="fig_6ptintorder"  /> shows that it is an interval order.

    <p>Note that end points of intervals used in a representation need not be distinct. In fact, distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> from <m>X</m> may satisfy <m>I(x)=I(y)</m>. We even allow degenerate intervals, <ie />, those of the form <m>[a,a]</m>. On the other hand, a representation is said to be <term>distinguishing</term><idx><h>interval representation</h><h>distinguishing</h></idx> if all intervals are non-degenerate and all end points are distinct. It is relatively easy to see that every interval order has a distinguishing representation.
    </p>
    <p>As we shall soon see, interval orders can be characterized succinctly in terms of forbidden subposets. Before stating this characterization, we need to introduce a bit more notation. By <m>\bfn</m> (for <m>n\geq 1</m> an integer), we mean the chain with <m>n</m> points. <notation><usage><m>\bfn</m></usage><description>chain with <m>n</m> points</description></notation> More precisely, we take the ground set to be <m>\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}</m> with <m>i \lt j</m> in <m>\bfn</m> if and only if <m>i\lt j</m> in <m>\ints</m>. If <m>\PXP</m> and <m>\QYQ</m> are posets with <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> disjoint, then <m>\bfP+\bfQ</m><notation><usage><m>\bfP+\bfQ</m></usage><description>disjoint sum of posets</description></notation> is the poset <m>\bfR=(X\cup Y,R)</m> where the partial order is given by <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>R</m> if and only if (a) <m>z,w\in X</m> and <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>P</m> or (b) <m>z,w\in Y</m> and <m>z\leq w</m> in <m>Q</m>. Thus, <m>\bfn+\bfm</m> consists of a chain with <m>n</m> points and a chain with <m>m</m> points and no comparabilities between them. In particular, <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m> can be viewed as a four-point poset with ground set <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m> and <m>a\lt b</m> and <m>c\lt d</m> as the only relations (other than those required to make the relation reflexive).

    <theorem xml:id="thm_fishburn">
        <title>Fishburn's Theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>\PXP</m> be a poset. Then <m>\bfP</m> is an interval order if and only if it excludes <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
            <p>We show only that an interval order cannot contain a subposet isomorphic to <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>, deferring the proof in the other direction to the next section. Now suppose that <m>\PXP</m> is a poset, <m>\{x,y,z,w\}\subseteq X</m> and the subposet determined by these four points is isomorphic to <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>.  We show that <m>\bfP</m> is not an interval order. Suppose to the contrary that <m>I</m> is an interval representation of <m>\bfP</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume that <m>x\lt y</m> and <m>z\lt w</m> in <m>P</m>. Thus <m>x\Vert w</m> and <m>z\Vert y</m> in <m>P</m>. Then <m>b_x\lt a_y</m> and <m>b_z \lt a_w</m> in <m>\reals</m> so that <m>a_w \le b_x \lt a_y \le b_z</m>, which is a contradiction.
