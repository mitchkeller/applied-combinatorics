Xing wonders if the fact that the graph does not contain a <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_3\)</span> has any bearing on the chromatic number. Dave’s in a hurry to get to the gym, but on his way out the door he says they can get a proper <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-coloring pretty easily, so <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG)\leq 4\text{.}\)</span> The rest decide it’s time to keep reading.</div>
