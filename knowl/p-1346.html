<div class="para">Zori was the first to say something “Ok guys, I’ve finally willing to accept the premise that big integer arithmetic, and things that reflect the same flavor, might and I emphasize might, have some relevance in the real world, but this conversation about dessert in some stupid diner is too much.” Xing was hesitant but still offered “There’s something here. That much I’m sure.” Dave said “Yeah, a great dessert. Especially the pecan pie.” Alice was not amused. All the while Carlos was thinking. Finally, he said “I think it has something to do with conditional probability. The patron’s preference for pecan pie was conditioned on the fact that there were three choices. When there were only two choices, his preferences changed.”</div>
