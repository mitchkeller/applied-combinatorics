<div class="para">To systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_squares.html" title="Figure 15.1">Figure 15.1</a> are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations’ effects on the colorings, let’s take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> the upper-right vertex to be <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> the lower-right vertex to be <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> and the lower-left vertex to be <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> We denote the clockwise rotation by <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> and see that <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> sends the vertex in position <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to position <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> the vertex in position <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> to position <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> the vertex in position <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> to position <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> and the vertex in position <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> to position <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> For brevity, we will write <span class="process-math">\(r_1(1) =2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_1(2)=3\text{,}\)</span> etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by <span class="process-math">\(180^\circ\)</span> and denote that rotation by <span class="process-math">\(r_2\text{.}\)</span> In this case, we find that <span class="process-math">\(r_2(1) = 3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_2(2)=4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_2(3)= 1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_2(4)=2\text{.}\)</span> Notice that we can achieve the transformation <span class="process-math">\(r_2\)</span> by doing <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by <span class="process-math">\(270^\circ\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_3\text{,}\)</span> can be achieved by doing <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although by a different angle.)</div>
