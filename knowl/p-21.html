<div class="para">The conversion to MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr> allows us to make a wider variety of formats available:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr>: With responsive design using <abbr class="initialism">CSS</abbr>, we feel that the text now looks beautiful on personal computers, tablets, and even mobile phones. No longer will students be frantically resizing a PDF on their phone in order to try to read a passage from the text. The “knowls” offered in <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> also allow references to images, tables, and even theorems from other pages (or even a distance away on the same page) to provide a copy of the image/table/theorem right there, and another click/tap makes it disappear.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr>: Not much is changed here from previous years, other than the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> is produced from the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> that MathBook <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr> generates, and so numbering and order is consistent with the <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> version.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Print: Campus bookstores have frequently produced printed versions of the text from the <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> provided online, but we have not previously been able to provide a printed, bound version for purchase. With the 2016 edition, we are pleased to launch a print version available through a number of online purchase channels. Campus bookstores may also acquire the book through wholesale channels for sale directly to students. Because of the CreativeCommons license under which the text is released, campuses retain the option of selling their own printed version of the text for students, although this is likely only financially advantageous to students if only a few chapters of the text are being used.</div></li>
