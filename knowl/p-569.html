<div class="para">The purpose of discussing homeomorphic graphs is that two homeomorphic graphs have the same properties when it comes to being drawn in the plane. To see this, think about what happens to <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_5\)</span> if we form an elementary subdivision of it via any one of its edges. Clearly it remains nonplanar. In fact, if you take any nonplanar graph and form the elementary subdivision using any one of its edges, the resulting graph is nonplanar. The following very deep theorem was proved by the Polish mathematician Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1930. Its proof is beyond the scope of this text.</div>
