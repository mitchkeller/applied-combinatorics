<div class="para">Bob remarked, “I’m not sure I understand what’s being talked about here. I don’t see why it can’t be the case that all problems can be solved. Maybe we just don’t know how to do it.” Xing said, “Any finite problem <em class="emphasis">can</em> be solved. There is always a way to list all the possibilities, compare them one by one and take the best one as the answer.” Alice joined in, “Well, a problem might take a long time just because it is big. For example, suppose you are given two <abbr class="initialism">DVD</abbr>’s, each completely full with the data for a large integer.  How are you possibly going to multiply them together, even with a large computer and fancy software.” Carlos then offered, “But I think there are really hard problems that any algorithm will take a long time to solve and not just because the input size is large. At this point, I don’t know how to formulate such a problem but I suspect that they exist.”</div>
