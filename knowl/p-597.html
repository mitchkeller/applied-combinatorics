<div class="para">Let’s begin with some problems for which there are polynomial-time algorithms. Suppose you are given a graph on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices and asked whether or not the graph is connected. Here a positive answer can be justified by providing a spanning tree. On the other hand, a negative answer can be justified by providing a partition of the vertex sets <span class="process-math">\(V=V_1\cup V_2\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> non-empty subsets and having no edges with one end-point in <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and the other in <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="ch_graphalgorithms.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 12: Graph Algorithms">Chapter 12</a> we will discuss two efficient algorithms that find spanning trees in connected graphs. They can easily be modified to produce a partition showing the graph is disconnected.</div>
