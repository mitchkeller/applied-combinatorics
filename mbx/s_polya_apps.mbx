<title>Applications of P&#xf3;lya's Enumeration
  Formula</title>


<introduction>
<p>
This section explores a number of situations in which P&#xf3;lya's
enumeration formula can be used. The applications are from a variety
of domains and are arranged in increasing order of complexity,
beginning with an example from music theory and concluding with
counting nonisomorphic graphs.

<title>Counting musical scales</title>
<p>
Western music is generally based on a system of <m>12</m> equally-spaced
<em>notes</em>. Although these notes are usually named by letters of the
alphabet (with modifiers), for our purposes it will suffice to number
them as <m>0,1,\dots,11</m>. These notes are arranged into <em>octaves</em>
so that the next pitch after <m>11</m> is again named <m>0</m> and the pitch
before <m>0</m> is named <m>11</m>. For this reason, we may consider the system
of notes to correspond to the integers modulo <m>12</m>. With these
definitions, a <em>scale</em> is a subset of <m>\{0,1,\dots,11\}</m> arranged
in increasing order. A <em>transposition</em> of a scale is a uniform
transformation that replaces each note <m>x</m> of the scale by <m>x+a\pmod
12</m> for some constant <m>a</m>. Musicians consider two scales to be
equivalent if one is a transposition of the other. Since a scale is a
subset, no regard is paid to which note starts the scale, either. The
question we investigate in this section is <q>How many nonequivalent
scales are there consisting of precisely <m>k</m> notes?</q>
</p>

<p>
Because of the cyclic nature of the note names, we may consider
arranging them in order clockwise around a circle. Selecting the notes
for a scale then becomes a coloring problem if we say that selected
notes are colored black and unselected notes are colored white. In
<xref ref="fig_polya_scales" autoname="yes" />, we show three <m>5</m>-note scales using this
convention. Notice that since <m>S_2</m> can be obtained from <m>S_1</m> by
rotating it forward seven positions, <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m> are equivalent by
the transposition of adding <m>7</m>. However, <m>S_3</m> is not equivalent to
<m>S_1</m> or <m>S_2</m>, as it cannot be obtained from them by rotation. (Note
that <m>S_3</m> could be obtained from <m>S_1</m> if we allowed flips in
addition to rotations. Since the only operation allowed is the
transposition, which corresponds to rotation, they are inequivalent.)

<p>
We have now mathematically modeled musical scales as discrete
structures in a way that we can use P&#xf3;lya's enumeration
theorem. What is the group acting on our black/white colorings of the
vertices of a regular <m>12</m>-gon? One permutation in the group is <m>\tau
= (0\ 1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6\ 7\ 8\ 9\ 10\ 11)</m>, which corresponds to the
transposition by one note. In fact, every element of the group can be
realized as some power of <m>\tau</m> since only rotations are allowed and
<m>\tau</m> is the smallest possible rotation. Thus, the group acting on
the colorings is the <em>cyclic group of order <m>12</m></em>, denoted
<m>C_{12} =
\{\iota,\tau,\tau^2,\dots,\tau^{11}\}</m>. <xref ref="ex_polya_cyclic12">Exercise</xref>
asks you to write all the elements of this group in cycle
notation. The best way to do this is by multiplying <m>\tau^{i-1}</m> by
<m>\tau</m> (i.e., compute <m>\tau\tau^{i-1}</m>) to find <m>\tau</m>. Once you've
done this, you will be able to easily verify that the cycle index is
</p>
<me>
  P_{C_{12}}(x_1,\dots,x_{12}) = \frac{x_1^{12}}{12}+\frac{x_2^6}{12}+\frac{x_3^4}{6}+\frac{x_4^3}{6}+\frac{x_6^2}{6}+\frac{x_{12}}{3}.
</me>
<p>
Since we've chosen colorings using black and white, it would make
sense to substitute <m>x_i = b^i +w^i</m> for all <m>i</m> in <m>P_{C_{12}}</m> now
to find the number of <m>k</m>-note scales. However, there is a convenient
shortcut we may take to make the resulting generating function look
more like those to which we grew accustomed in
<xref ref="ch_genfunction" autoname="yes" />. The information about how many notes are
<em>not</em> included in our scale (the number colored white) can be
deduced from the number that are included. Thus, we may eliminate the
use of the variable <m>w</m>, replacing it by <m>1</m>. We now find
</p>
<md>P_{C_{12}}(1+b,1+b^2,\dots,1+b^{12}) = b^{12}+b^{11}+6 b^{10}+19 b^9+43 b^8+66 b^7+80 b^6\\+66 b^5+43 b^4+19 b^3+6 b^2+b+1.
</md>
<p>
From this, we are able to deduce that the number of scales with <m>k</m>
notes is the coefficient on <m>b^k</m>. Therefore, the answer to our
question at the beginning of the chapter about the number of <m>6</m>-note
scales is <m>80</m>.

<subsection xml:id="ss_polya_isomers">
<title>Enumerating isomers</title>
<p>
Benzene is a chemical compound with formula <m>\text{C} _6\text{H} _6</m>,
meaning it consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. These
atoms are bonded in such a way that the six carbon atoms form a
hexagonal ring with alternating single and double bonds. A hydrogen
atom is bonded to each carbon atom (on the outside of the ring). From
benzene it is possible to form other chemical compounds that are part
of a family known as <em>aromatic hydrocarbons</em>. These compounds are
formed by replacing one or more of the hydrogen atoms by atoms of
other elements or functional groups such as <m>\text{CH} _3</m> (methyl
group) or <m>\text{OH}</m> (hydroxyl group). Because there are six choices
for which hydrogen atoms to replace, molecules with the same chemical
formula but different structures can be formed in this manner. Such
molecules are called <em>isomers</em>. In this subsection, we will see
how P&#xf3;lya's enumeration theorem can be used to determine the number
of isomers of the aromatic hydrocarbon xylenol (also known as
dimethylphenol).
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the molecular structure of xylenol, we need to
discuss the permutation group that will act on a benzene ring. Much
like with our example of coloring the vertices of the square, we find
that there are rotations and flips at play here. In fact, the group we
require is the dihedral group of the hexagon, <m>D_{12}</m>. If we number
the six carbon atoms in clockwise order as <m>1,2,\dots,6</m>, then we find
that the clockwise rotation by <m>60^\circ</m> corresponds to the
permutation <m>r=(123456)</m>. The other rotations are the higher powers of
<m>r</m>, as shown in <xref ref="tab_polya_benzene" autoname="yes" />. The flip across the
vertical axis is the permutation <m>f=(16)(25)(34)</m>. The remaining
elements of <m>D_{12}</m> (other than the identity <m>\iota</m>) can all be
realized as some rotation followed by this flip. The full list of
permutations is shown in <xref ref="tab_polya_benzene" autoname="yes" />, where each
permutation is accompanied by the monomial it contributes to the cycle
index.

</figure>
<p>
With the monomials associated to the permutations in <m>D_{12}</m> identified,
we are able to write down the cycle index
</p>
<me>
  P_{D_{12}}(x_1,\dots,x_6) = \frac{1}{12}(x_1^6 + 2x_6^1 + 2x_3^2+4x_2^3 + 3x_1^2x_2^2).
</me>
<p>
With the cycle index determined, we now turn our attention to using it
to find the number of isomers of xylenol. This aromatic hydrocarbon
has three hydrogen molecules, two methyl groups, and a hydroxyl group
attached to the carbon atoms. Recalling that hydrogen atoms are the
default from benzene, we can more or less ignore them when choosing
the appropriate substitution for the <m>x_i</m> in the cycle index. If we
let <m>m</m> denote methyl groups and <m>h</m> hydroxyl groups, we can then
substitute <m>x_i = 1+m^i+h^i</m> in <m>P_{D_{12}}</m>. This substitution gives the
generating function
</p>
<md>1+h+3 h^2+3 h^3+3 h^4+h^5+h^6+m+3 h m+6 h^2 m+6 h^3
  m\\+3 h^4 m+h^5 m+3 m^2+6 h m^2+11 h^2 m^2+6 h^3 m^2+3 h^4 m^2+3
  m^3+6 h m^3\\+6 h^2 m^3+3 h^3 m^3+3 m^4+3 h m^4+3 h^2 m^4+m^5+h
  m^5+m^6.
</md>
<p>
Since xylenol has one hydroxyl group and two methyl groups, we are
looking for the coefficient on <m>hm^2</m> in this generating function. The
coefficient is <m>6</m>, so there are six isomers of xylenol.
</p>

<p>
In his original paper, P&#xf3;lya used his techniques to enumerate the
number of isomers of the alkanes <m>\text{C} _n\text{H} _{2n+2}</m>. When
modeled as graphs, these chemical compounds are special types of
trees. Since that time, P&#xf3;lya's enumeration theorem has been used to
enumerate isomers for many different chemical compounds.

<subsection xml:id="ss_polya_graphs">
<title>Counting nonisomorphic graphs</title>
<p>
Counting the graphs with vertex set <m>[n]</m> is not difficult. There are
<m>C(n,2)</m> possible edges, each of which can be included or
excluded. Thus, there are <m>2^{C(n,2)}</m> <em>labeled</em> graphs on <m>n</m>
vertices. It's only a bit of extra thought to determine that if you
only want to count the labeled graphs on <m>n</m> vertices with <m>k</m> edges,
you simply must choose a <m>k</m>-element subset of the set of all <m>C(n,2)</m>
possible edges. Thus, there are
</p>
<me>
  \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{k}
</me>
<p>
graphs with vertex set <m>[n]</m> and exactly <m>k</m> edges.
</p>

<p>
A more difficult problem arises when we want to start counting
<em>nonisomorphic</em> graphs on <m>n</m> vertices. (One can think of these
as <em>unlabeled</em> graphs as well.) For example, in
<xref ref="fig_polya_graphs" autoname="yes" />, we show four different labeled graphs on
four vertices. The first three graphs shown there, however, are
isomorphic to each other. Thus, only two nonisomorphic graphs on four
vertices are illustrated in the figure. To account for isomorphisms,
we need to bring P&#xf3;lya's enumeration theorem into play.

<p>
We begin by considering all <m>2^{C(n,2)}</m> graphs with vertex set <m>[n]</m>
and choosing an appropriate permutation group to act in the
situation. Since any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex, the
symmetric group <m>S_4</m> acts on the vertices. However, we have to be
careful about how we find the cycle index here. When we were working
with colorings of the vertices of the square, we realized that all the
vertices appearing in the same cycle of a permutation <m>\pi</m> had to be
colored the same color. Since we're concerned with edges here and not
vertex colorings, what we really need for a permutation to fix a graph
is that every edge be sent to an edge and every non-edge be sent to a
non-edge. To be specific, if <m>\{1,2\}</m> is an edge of some <m>\bfG</m> and
<m>\pi\in S_4</m> fixes <m>\bfG</m>, then <m>\{\pi(1),\pi(2)\}</m> must also be an
edge of <m>\bfG</m>. Similarly, if vertices <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are not adjacent in
<m>\bfG</m>, then <m>\pi(3)</m> and <m>\pi(4)</m> must also be nonadjacent in
<m>\bfG</m>.
</p>

<p>
To account for edges, we move from the symmetric group <m>S_4</m> to its
<em>pair group</em> <m>S_4^{(2)}</m>. The objects that <m>S_4^{(2)}</m> permutes
are the <m>2</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>. For ease of notation, we
will denote the <m>2</m>-element subset <m>\{i,j\}</m> by <m>e_{ij}</m>. To find the
permutations in <m>S_4^{(2)}</m>, we consider the vertex permutations in
<m>S_4</m> and see how they permute the <m>e_{ij}</m>. The identity permutation
<m>\iota=(1)(2)(3)(4)</m> of <m>S_4</m> corresponds to the identity permutation
<m>\iota=(e_{12})(e_{13}) (e_{14}) (e_{23}) (e_{24}) (e_{34})</m> of
<m>S_4^{(2)}</m>. Now let's consider the permutation <m>(12)(3)(4)</m>. It fixes
<m>e_{12}</m> since it sends <m>1</m> to <m>2</m> and <m>2</m> to <m>1</m>. It also fixeds
<m>e_{34}</m> by fixing <m>3</m> and <m>4</m>. However, it interchanges <m>e_{13}</m> with
<m>e_{23}</m> (<m>3</m> is fixed and <m>1</m> is swapped with <m>2</m>) and <m>e_{14}</m> with
<m>e_{24}</m> (<m>1</m> is sent to <m>2</m> and <m>4</m> is fixed). Thus, the
corresponding permutation of pairs is
<m>(e_{12})(e_{13}e_{23})(e_{14}e_{24})(e_{34})</m>. For another example,
consider the permutation <m>(123)(4)</m>. It corresponds to the permutation
<m>(e_{12}e_{23}e_{13})(e_{14}e_{24}e_{34})</m> in <m>S_4^{(2)}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Since we're only after the cycle index of <m>S_4^{(2)}</m>, we don't need
to find all <m>24</m> permutations in the pair group. However, we do need
to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so
we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples
we've considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair
group doesn't depend on the original permutation in <m>S_4</m> other than
for <em>its</em> cycle structure. Any permutation in <m>S_4</m> consisting of
a <m>2</m>-cycle and two <m>1</m>-cycles will correspond to a permutation with
two <m>2</m>-cycles and two <m>1</m>-cycles in <m>S_4^{(2)}</m>. A permutation in
<m>S_4</m> with one <m>3</m>-cycle and one <m>1</m>-cycle will correspond to a
permutation with two <m>3</m>-cycles in the pair group. By considering an
example of a permutation in <m>S_4</m> consisting of a single <m>4</m>-cycle, we
find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a
<m>4</m>-cycle and a <m>2</m>-cycle. Finally, a permutation of <m>S_4</m> consisting
of two <m>2</m>-cycles corresponds to a permutation in <m>S_4^{(2)}</m> having
two <m>2</m>-cycles and two
<m>1</m>-cycles. (<xref ref="ex_polya_perm-pairs">Exercise</xref>
asks you to verify these claims using specific permutations.)
</p>

<p>
Now that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in
<m>S_4^{(2)}</m>, the only task remaining before we can find its cycle
index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the
possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to
permutations of the symmetric group <m>S_4</m>. A permutation consisting of
a single <m>4</m>-cycle begins with <m>1</m> and then has <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, and <m>4</m> in
any of the <m>3!=6</m> possible orders, so there are <m>6</m> such
permutations. For permutations consisting of a <m>1</m>-cycle and a
<m>3</m>-cycle, there are <m>4</m> ways to choose the element for the <m>1</m>-cycle
and then <m>2</m> ways to arrange the other three as a <m>3</m>-cycle. (Remember
the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then <m>2</m> ways
to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are <m>8</m> such
permutations. For a permutation consisting of two <m>1</m>-cycles and a
<m>2</m>-cycle, there are <m>C(4,2)=6</m> ways to choose the two elements for
the <m>2</m>-cycle. Thus, there are <m>6</m> such permutations. For a
permutation to consist of two <m>2</m>-cycles, there are <m>C(4,2)=6</m> ways to
choose two elements for the first <m>2</m>-cycle. The other two are then
put in the second <m>2</m>-cycle. However, this counts each permutation
twice, once for when the first <m>2</m>-cycle is the chosen pair and once
for when it is the <q>other two.</q> Thus, there are <m>3</m> permutations
consisting of two <m>2</m>-cycles. Finally, only <m>\iota</m> consists of four
<m>1</m>-cycles.
</p>

<p>
Now we're prepared to write down the cycle index of the pair group
</p>
<me>
  P_{S_4^{(2)}}(x_1,\dots,x_6) = \frac{1}{24}\left( x_6^1 + 9x_1^2x_2^2 + 8 x_3^2 +
  6x_2x_4\right).
</me>
<p>
To use this to enumerate graphs, we can now make the substitution <m>x_i
= 1+x^i</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq 6</m>. This allows us to account for the two
options of an edge not being present or being present. In doing so, we
find
</p>
<me>
  P_{S_4^{(2)}}(1+x,\dots,1+x^6)= 1+x+2 x^2+3 x^3+2 x^4+x^5+x^6
</me>
<p>
is the generating function for the number of <m>4</m>-vertex graphs with
<m>m</m> edges, <m>0\leq m\leq 6</m>. To find the total number of nonisomorphic
graphs on four vertices, we substitute <m>x=1</m> into this
polynomial. This allows us to conclude there are <m>11</m> nonisomorphic
graphs on four vertices, a marked reduction from the <m>64</m> labeled
graphs.
</p>

<p>
The techniques of this subsection can be used, given enough computing
power, to find the number of nonisomorphic graphs on any number of
vertices. For <m>30</m> vertices, there are

<p>
The last part of the question about graph enumeration at the beginning
of the chapter was about enumerating the graphs on some number of
vertices in which every vertex has degree <m>r</m>. While this might seem
like it could be approached using the techniques of this chapter, it
turns out that it cannot because of the increased dependency between
where vertices are mapped.
