<div class="para">Here we will use the Lov√°sz Local Lemma to obtain this same lower bound in a much more direct manner. We consider a random graph on <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> vertices with edge probability <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>  For each <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-element subset <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> we have the event <span class="process-math">\(E_S\)</span> which is true when <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> forms a triangle. For each <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-element set <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> we have the event <span class="process-math">\(E_T\)</span> which is true when <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is an independent set. In the discussion to follow, we abuse notation slightly and refer to events <span class="process-math">\(E_S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E_T\)</span> as just <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> respectively. Note that the probability of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(p^3\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-element set <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> while the probability of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(q=(1-p)^{C(n,2)}\sim e^{-pn^2/2}\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-element set <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>
