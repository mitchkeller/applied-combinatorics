<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is a permutation, every component of such a digraph is a directed cycle. We can then use these cycles to write down the permutation in a compact manner. For each cycle, we start at the vertex with smallest label and go around the cycle in the direction of the edges, writing down the vertices’ labels in order. We place this sequence of integers in parentheses. For the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_perm-digraph.html" title="Figure 15.3">Figure 15.3</a>, we thus obtain <span class="process-math">\((1245)\text{.}\)</span> (If <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 10\text{,}\)</span> we place spaces or commas between the integers.) The component with a single vertex is denoted simply as <span class="process-math">\((3)\text{,}\)</span> and thus we may write <span class="process-math">\(\pi=(1245)(3)\text{.}\)</span> By convention, the disjoint cycles of a permutation are listed so that their first entries are in increasing order.</div>
