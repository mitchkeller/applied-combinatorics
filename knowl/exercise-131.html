<div class="para">A graduate student eats lunch in the campus food court every Tuesday over the course of a <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span>-week semester. He is joined each week by some subset of a group of six friends from across campus. Over the course of a semester, he ate lunch with each friend <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> times, each pair <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> times, and each triple <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> times. He ate lunch with each group of four friends <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> times and each group of five friends <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> times. All seven of them ate lunch together only once that semester. Did the graduate student ever eat lunch alone?  If so, how many times?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_inclusion-exclusion_exercises.html#exercise-131" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
