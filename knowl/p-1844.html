<div class="para">This appendix treats background material essential to the study of combinatorial mathematics. Many students will find that most—and perhaps all—of this material has been covered somewhere in their prior course work, and we expect that very few instructors will include this appendix in the syllabus. Nevertheless, students may find it convenient to consult this appendix from time to time, and we suspect that many instructors will encourage students to read this material to refresh their memories of key concepts.</div>
