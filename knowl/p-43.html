<div class="para">Amanda has three children:   Dawn, Keesha and Seth.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Amanda has ten one dollar bills and decides to give the full amount to her children.  How many ways can she do this?  For example, one way she might distribute the funds is to give Dawn and Keesha four dollars each with Seth receiving the balance—two dollars.  Another way is to give the entire amount to Keesha, an option that probably won’t make Dawn and Seth very happy.  Note that hidden within this question is the assumption that Amanda does not distinguish the individual dollar bills, say by carefully examining their serial numbers.  Instead, we intend that she need only decide the <em class="emphasis">amount</em> each of the three children is to receive.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The amounts of money distributed to the three children form a sequence which if written in non-increasing order has the form: <span class="process-math">\(a_1, a_2, a_3\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(a_1\ge a_2\ge a_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_1+a_2+a_3=10\text{.}\)</span>  How many such sequences are there?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one dollar.  How does this change the answers to the first two questions?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now suppose that Amanda has ten books, in fact the top 10 books from the New York Times best-seller list, and decides to give them to her children.  How many ways can she do this?  Again, we note that there is a hidden assumption—the ten books are all different.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose the ten books are labeled <span class="process-math">\(B_1, B_2,\dots, B_{10}\text{.}\)</span>  The sets of books given to the three children are pairwise disjoint and their union is <span class="process-math">\(\{B_1,B_2,\dots,B_{10}\}\text{.}\)</span>  How many different sets of the form <span class="process-math">\(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(S_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> are pairwise disjoint and <span class="process-math">\(S_1\cup S_2\cup S_3=\{B_1,B_2,\dots,B_{10}\}\text{?}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one book.  How does this change the answers to the preceding two questions?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How would we possibly answer these kinds of questions if ten was really ten thousand (OK, we’re not talking about children any more!)  and three was three thousand?  Could you write the answer on a single page in a book?</div></li>
