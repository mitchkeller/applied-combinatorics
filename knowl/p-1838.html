<em class="emphasis">Alice</em> and <em class="emphasis">Bob</em> got married, moved to Austin, Texas, and started a high tech firm using venture capital provided by a successful Georgia Tech grad. Alice is CEO and the pattern of making quick decisions, most of which are right, continues to this day. Bob is CFO and the financial health of the firm is guaranteed.  The first year though was pretty tough, but after that, their reputation got established and contracts began to walk through the door. There’s even talk about an IPO in the near future. Alice and Bob don’t have much time to decide whether they are happy with the way their lives are going—but we’re pretty sure they are.</div>
