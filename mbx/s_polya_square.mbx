<title>Coloring the Vertices of a Square</title>
<p>
Let's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and
gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are
<m>2^4=16</m> different colorings. These colorings are shown in
<xref ref="fig_polya_squares" autoname="yes" />.

However, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead
or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and
flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are
equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring <m>C_7</m> over about the
vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring
<m>C_9</m>. If we rotate coloring <m>C_2</m> clockwise by <m>90^\circ</m>, we obtain
coloring <m>C_3</m>. In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent
colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of
necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to
differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped
to become the other.)
</p>

<p>
To systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in
<xref ref="fig_polya_squares" autoname="yes" /> are not equivalent, we must think about
the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to
the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the
colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the
vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be <m>1</m>, the
upper-right vertex to be <m>2</m>, the lower-right vertex to be <m>3</m>, and
the lower-left vertex to be <m>4</m>. We denote the clockwise rotation by
<m>90^\circ</m> by <m>r_1</m> and see that <m>r_1</m> sends the vertex in position
<m>1</m> to position <m>2</m>, the vertex in position <m>2</m> to position <m>3</m>, the
vertex in position <m>3</m> to position <m>4</m>, and the vertex in position <m>4</m>
to position <m>1</m>. For brevity, we will write <m>r_1(1) =2</m>, <m>r_1(2)=3</m>,
etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by <m>180^\circ</m> and denote
that rotation by <m>r_2</m>. In this case, we find that <m>r_2(1) = 3</m>,
<m>r_2(2)=4</m>, <m>r_2(3)= 1</m>, and <m>r_2(4)=2</m>. Notice that we can achieve
the transformation <m>r_2</m> by doing <m>r_1</m> twice in
succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by <m>270^\circ</m>, <m>r_3</m>,
can be achieved by doing <m>r_1</m> three times in
succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that
they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although by a
different angle.)
</p>

<p>
When it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which
we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and
negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by <m>v</m>, <m>h</m>, <m>p</m>, and
<m>n</m>, respectively. Now notice that <m>v(1) = 2</m>, <m>v(2) = 1</m>, <m>v(3) = 4</m>,
and <m>v(4) = 3</m>. For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have <m>h(1)
= 4</m>, <m>h(2) = 3</m>, <m>h(3)=2</m>, and <m>h(4)= 1</m>. For <m>p</m>, we have <m>p(1) =
3</m>, <m>p(2) = 2</m>, <m>p(3)=1</m>, and <m>p(4)=4</m>. Finally, for <m>n</m> we find <m>n(1)
= 1</m>, <m>n(2) = 4</m>, <m>n(3) = 3</m>, and <m>n(4)=2</m>. There is one more
transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does
nothing to the square is called the <em>identity transformation</em>,
denoted <m>\iota</m>. It has <m>\iota(1)=1</m>, <m>\iota(2)=2</m>, <m>\iota(3)=3</m>, and
<m>\iota(4)=4</m>.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've identified the eight transformations of the square,
let's make a table showing which colorings from
<xref ref="fig_polya_squares" autoname="yes" /> are left unchanged by the application of
each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation
leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because <m>r_1</m> moves the
vertices cyclically, we see that only <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_{16}</m> remain
unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color
would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other
color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by <m>v</m>, the flip about
the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position <m>1</m> must
be the same as the color at position <m>2</m>, and the color at position
<m>3</m> must be the same as the color at position <m>4</m>. Thus, we would
expect to find <m>2\cdot 2 = 4</m> colorings unchanged by <m>v</m>. Examining
<xref ref="fig_polya_squares" autoname="yes" />, we see that these colorings are <m>C_1</m>,
<m>C_6</m>, <m>C_8</m>, and <m>C_{16}</m>. Performing a similar analysis for the
remaining five transformations leads to
<xref ref="tab_polya_fixed-square" autoname="yes" />.

<p>
At this point, it's natural to ask where this is going. After all,
we're trying to count the number of <em>nonequivalent</em> colorings,
and <xref ref="tab_polya_fixed-square" autoname="yes" /> makes no effort to group
colorings based on how a transformation changes one coloring to
another. It turns out that there is a useful connection between
counting the nonequivalent colorings and determining the number of
colorings fixed by each transformation. To develop this connection, we
first need to discuss the equivalence relation created by the action
of the transformations of the square on the set <m>\cgC</m> of all
<m>2</m>-colorings of the square. (Refer to
<xref ref="s_background_equivalence" autoname="yes" /> for a refresher on the definition of
equivalence relation.) To do this, notice that applying a
transformation to a square with colored vertices results in another
square with colored vertices. For instance, applying the
transformation <m>r_1</m> to a square colored as in <m>C_{12}</m> results in a
square colored as in <m>C_{13}</m>. We say that the transformations of the
square <em>act</em> on the set <m>\cgC</m> of colorings. We denote this
action by adding a star to the transformation name. For instance,
<m>r_1^*(C_{12})=C_{13}</m> and <m>v^*(C_{10})=C_{11}</m>.
</p>

<p>
If <m>\tau</m> is a transformation of the square with <m>\tau^*(C_i) = C_j</m>,
then we say colorings <m>C_i</m> and <m>C_j</m> are <em>equivalent</em> and write
<m>C_i\sim C_j</m>. Since <m>\iota^*(C)=C</m> for all <m>C\in\cgC</m>, <m>\sim</m> is
reflexive. If <m>\tau_1^*(C_i) = C_j</m> and <m>\tau_2^*(C_j) = C_k</m>, then
<m>\tau_2^*(\tau_1^*(C_i)) = C_k</m>, so <m>\sim</m> is transitive. To complete
our verification that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation, we must
establish that it is symmetric. For this, we require the notion of the
<em>inverse</em> of a transformation <m>\tau</m>, which is simply the
transformation <m>\tau\inv</m> that undoes whatever <m>\tau</m> did. For
instance, the inverse of <m>r_1</m> is the <em>counter</em>clockwise rotation
by <m>90^\circ</m>, which has the same effect on the location of the
vertices as <m>r_3</m>. If <m>\tau^*(C_i) = C_j</m>, then <m>{\tau^{-1}}^*(C_j) =
C_i</m>, so <m>\sim</m> is symmetric.
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to establish the connection between the number of
nonequivalent colorings (equivalence classes under <m>\sim</m>) and the
number of colorings fixed by a transformation in full generality,
let's see how it looks for our example. In looking at
<xref ref="fig_polya_squares" autoname="yes" />, you should notice that <m>\sim</m> partitions
<m>\cgC</m> into six equivalence classes. Two contain one coloring each
(the all white and all gold colorings). One contains two colorings
(<m>C_{10}</m> and <m>C_{11}</m>). Finally, three contain four colorings each
(one gold vertex, one white vertex, and the remaining four with two
vertices of each color). Now look again at
<xref ref="tab_polya_fixed-square" autoname="yes" /> and add up the number of colorings
fixed by each transformation. In doing this, we obtain <m>48</m>, and when
<m>48</m> is divided by the number of transformations (<m>8</m>), we get <m>6</m>
(the number of equivalence classes)! It turns out that this is far
from a fluke, as we will soon see. First, however, we introduce the
concept of a permutation group to generalize our set of
transformations of the square.
