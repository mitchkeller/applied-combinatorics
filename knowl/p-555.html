<div class="para">By a <dfn class="terminology">drawing</dfn> of a graph, we mean a way of associating its vertices with points in the Cartesian plane <span class="process-math">\(\reals^2\)</span> and its edges with simple polygonal arcs whose endpoints are the points associated to the vertices that are the endpoints of the edge. You can think of a polygonal arc as just a finite sequence of line segments such that the endpoint of one line segment is the starting point of the next line segment, and a simple polygonal arc is one that does not cross itself. (Our choice of polygonal arcs rather than arbitrary curves actually doesnâ€™t cause an impediment, since by taking very, very, very short line segments we can approximate any curve.) A <dfn class="terminology">planar drawing</dfn> of a graph is one in which the polygonal arcs corresponding to two edges intersect only at a point corresponding to a vertex to which they are both incident. A graph is <dfn class="terminology">planar</dfn> if it has a planar drawing. A <dfn class="terminology">face</dfn> of a planar drawing of a graph is a region bounded by edges and vertices and not containing any other vertices or edges.</div>
