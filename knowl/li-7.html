<div class="para">Amanda has ten one dollar bills and decides to give the full amount to her children.  How many ways can she do this?  For example, one way she might distribute the funds is to give Dawn and Keesha four dollars each with Seth receiving the balance—two dollars.  Another way is to give the entire amount to Keesha, an option that probably won’t make Dawn and Seth very happy.  Note that hidden within this question is the assumption that Amanda does not distinguish the individual dollar bills, say by carefully examining their serial numbers.  Instead, we intend that she need only decide the <em class="emphasis">amount</em> each of the three children is to receive.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_intro_enum.html#li-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
