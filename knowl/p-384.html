<div class="para">Zori was losing her patience and was especially grumpy today “I don’t see any value to any of this stuff. Who’s going to pay me to find greatest common divisors?” Dave said “Nobody.” Alice said, “But maybe there are some principles here that have practical application.” Carlos joined in, saying “I think the basic principles behind establishing that a computer program does what you intend have a lot to do with induction and recursion.” Bob said “I don’t understand. When I write a program, I just pay attention to details and after just a few corrections, they always work.” Alice was brutal “Maybe that’s because you don’t do anything complicated.” Carlos was more gentle “Big software projects might have hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and pieces of the final product might be written by different groups of programmers at different moments in time.  Establishing correctness can be a very difficult task.” Zori’s ears perked up as she thought she saw something in this last bit of conversation that might be a way to earn a salary.</div>
