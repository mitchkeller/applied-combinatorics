<div class="para">Considering the applications suggested at the beginning of the chapter, it is natural to ask for the maximum value of a flow in a given network. Put another way, we want to find the largest number <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> so that there exists a flow <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> of value <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> in the network. Of course, we not only want to find the maximum value <span class="process-math">\(v_0\text{,}\)</span> but we also want to find a flow <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> having this value. Although it may seem a bit surprising, we will develop an efficient algorithm which both finds a flow of maximum value <em class="emphasis">and</em> finds a certificate verifying the claim of optimality. This certificate makes use of the following important concept.</div>
