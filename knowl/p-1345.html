<div class="para">Bob was late for morning coffee and the group was well into dissecting today’s applied combinatorics class.  As he approached the table, he blurted out “Ok guys, here’s a problem that doesn’t make any sense to me, except that Nadja, my friend from biology, says that if I have a good feel for probability, then it is transparent.” Alice not very softly interjected “Not much goes through six inches of iron.” Bob didn’t bite “A guy eats lunch at the same diner every day. After lunch, the waiter asks if he wants dessert. He asks for the choices and the waiter replies ‘We have three kinds of pie: apple, cherry and pecan.’ Then the guy always says ‘I’ll have pecan pie.’ This goes on for six months. Then one day, the waiter says ‘I have bad news. Today, we don’t have any apple pie, so your only choices are cherry and pecan.’  Now the guy says ‘In this case, I’ll have the cherry pie.’ I have to tell you all that this doesn’t make any sense to me.  Why would the guy ask for cherry pie in preference to pecan pie when he consistently takes pecan pie over both cherry pie and apple pie?”</div>
