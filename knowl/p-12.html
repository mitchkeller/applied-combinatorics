<div class="para">Our approach to the course is to show students the beauty of combinatorics and how combinatorial problems naturally arise in many settings, particularly in computer science. While proofs are periodically presented in class, the course is not intended to teach students how to write proofs; there are other required courses in our curriculum that meet this need. Students may occasionally be asked to prove small facts, but these arguments are closer to the kind we expect from students in second or third semester calculus as contrasted with proofs we expect from a mathematics major in an upper-division course. Regardless, we cut very few corners, and our text can readily be used by instructors who elect to be even more rigorous in their approach.</div>
