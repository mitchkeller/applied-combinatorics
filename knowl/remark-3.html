<div class="para">Alice was surfing the web and found a site listing top movies, grouped by categories (comedy, drama, family, etc) as well as by the decade in which they were released. Alice was intrigued by the critic’s choices and rankings, especially for the top seven dramas from the 1990’s.  Alice agreed with the critic’s choices as a group but not the specific rankings. She wrote the critic’s rankings on the board and just to the right, she gave her own rankings, all the time insisting that she was certainly correct in her opinions.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel fixed-width top" style="width:100%;"><table class="tabular">
