    <title>Combinatorial Basics</title>


    <introduction>
        <p>Dave hates doing the same thing twice. He sees himself as a free spirit and never wants to fall into a rut. Alice says that this approach to life requires one to have lots and lots of options, for if you have to do a lot of something, like get up in the morning and get dressed, then you may not be able to avoid mindless repetition, dull and boring as it may seem.
