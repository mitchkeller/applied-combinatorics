<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> is a graph, a set <span class="process-math">\(M\subseteq E\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">matching</dfn> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> if no two edges of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> share an endpoint. If <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a vertex that is the endpoint of an edge in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> we say that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> saturates <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is saturated by <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is bipartite with <span class="process-math">\(V=V_1\cup V_2\text{,}\)</span> a matching is then a way to pair vertices in <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> with vertices in <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> so that no vertex is paired with more than one other vertex. We’re usually interested in finding a <dfn class="terminology">maximum matching</dfn>, which is a matching that contains the largest number of edges possible, and in bipartite graphs we usually fix the sets <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> and seek a maximum matching from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{.}\)</span> In our workers and jobs example, the matching problem thus becomes trying to find an assignment of workers to jobs such that</div>
