    <title>Newton's Binomial Theorem</title>
    <p>In <xref ref="ch_strings"  />, we discussed the binomial theorem and saw that the following formula holds for all integers <m>p\ge1</m>:
    <me>
        (1+x)^p =\sum_{n=0}^{p}\binom{p}{n} x^n.
    </me>
        You should quickly realize that this formula implies that the generating function for the number of <m>n</m>-element subsets of a <m>p</m>-element set is <m>(1+x)^p</m>. The topic of generating functions is what leads us to consider what happens if we encounter <m>(1+x)^p</m> as a generating function with <m>p</m> not a positive integer. It turns out that, by suitably extending the definition of the binomial coefficients to real numbers, we can also extend the binomial theorem in a manner originally discovered by Sir Isaac Newton.
    </p>

    <p>We've seen several expressions that can be used to calculate the binomial coefficients, but in order to extend <m>C(p,k)</m> to real values of <m>p</m>, we will utilize the form
    <me>
        \binom{p}{k}=\frac{P(p,k)}{k!},
    </me>
    recalling that we've defined <m>P(p,k)</m> recursively as <m>P(p,0)=1</m> for all integers <m>p\geq 0</m> and <m>P(p,k)=p P(p-1,k-1)</m> when <m>p\geq k > 0</m> (<m>k</m> an integer). Notice here, however, that the expression for <m>P(p,k)</m> makes sense for any real number <m>p</m>, so long as <m>k</m> is a non-negative integer. We make this definition formal.
    </p>
    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>For all real numbers <m>p</m> and nonnegative integers <m>k</m>, the number <m>P(p,k)</m> is defined by
            <ol>
                <li><m>P(p,0)=1</m> for all real numbers <m>p</m> and</li>
                <li><m>P(p,k) = p P(p-1,k-1)</m> for all real numbers <m>p</m> and integers <m>k>0</m>.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>(Notice that this definition does not require <m>p\geq k</m> as we did with integers.)
    </p>

    <p>We are now prepared to extend the definition of binomial coefficient so that <m>C(p,k)</m> is defined for all real <m>p</m> and nonnegative integer values of <m>k</m>. We do this as follows.
    </p>
    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>For all real numbers <m>p</m> and nonnegative integers <m>k</m>,
            <me>
                \binom{p}{k}=\frac{P(p,k)}{k!}.
            </me>            <notation><usage>\binom{p}{k}</usage><description>generalized binomial coefficient</description></notation><idx><h>binomial coefficient</h><h>generalized</h></idx>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>Note that <m>P(p,k)=C(p,k)= 0</m> when <m>p</m> and <m>k</m> are integers with <m>0\le p\lt k</m>. On the other hand, we have interesting new concepts such as <m>P(-5,4)=(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8)</m> and
    <me>
        \binom{-7/2}{5}=\frac{(-7/2)(-9/2)(-11/2)(-13/2)(-15/2)}{5!}.
    </me>
    </p>
    <p>With this more general definition of binomial coefficients in hand, we're ready to state Newton's Binomial Theorem for all non-zero real numbers. The proof of this theorem can be found in most advanced calculus books.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_newton-binomial">
        <title>Newton's Binomial Theorem</title>
        <idx><h>binomial theorem</h><h>Newton's</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>
                For all real <m>p</m> with <m>p\neq0</m>,
            <me>
                (1+x)^p=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{p}{n}x^n.
            </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>Note that the general form reduces to the original version of the binomial theorem when <m>p</m> is a positive integer.
