<div class="para">Here’s an example of how <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_chebyshev.html" title="Theorem 10.24: Chebyshev’s Inequality">Chebyshev’s Inequality</a> can be applied.  Consider <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> tosses of a fair coin with <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> counting the number of heads. As noted before, <span class="process-math">\(\mu=E(X)=n/2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\var(X)=n/4\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\sigma_X=\sqrt{n}/2\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n=10,000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mu=5,000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sigma_X=50\text{.}\)</span> Setting <span class="process-math">\(k=50\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(k\sigma_X=2500\text{,}\)</span> we see that the probability that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is within <span class="process-math">\(2500\)</span> of the expected value of <span class="process-math">\(5000\)</span> is at least <span class="process-math">\(0.9996\text{.}\)</span>  So it seems very unlikely indeed that the number of heads is at least <span class="process-math">\(7,500\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Going back to lottery tickets, if we make the rational assumption that all ticket numbers are equally likely, then the probability that the winning number is at least <span class="process-math">\(7,500\)</span> is exactly <span class="process-math">\(2501/100001\text{,}\)</span> which is very close to <span class="process-math">\(1/4\text{.}\)</span>
