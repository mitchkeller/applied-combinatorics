<div class="para">In our study of ordinary generating functions earlier in this chapter, we considered examples where quantity (number of apples, etc.)  mattered but order did not. One of the areas where exponential generating functions are preferable to ordinary generating functions is in applications where order matters, such as counting strings. For instance, although the bit strings <span class="process-math">\(10001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(011000\)</span> both contain three zeros and two ones, they are not the same strings. On the other hand, two fruit baskets containing two apples and three oranges would be considered equivalent, regardless of how you arranged the fruit. We now consider a couple of examples to illustrate this technique.</div>
