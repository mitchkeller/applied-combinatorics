<div class="para">There are occasions where the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/princ_math-induction.html" title="Principle 3.11: Principle of Mathematical Induction">Principle of Mathematical Induction</a>, at least as we have studied it up to this point, does not seem sufficient.  Here is a concrete example.  The professor asked Bob to study a function <span class="process-math">\(f(n)\)</span> defined recursively by <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = 2f(n-1) - f(n-2)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(2)=5\text{.}\)</span> Specifically, the professor asked Bob to compute <span class="process-math">\(f(10^{10})\text{,}\)</span> which seems like a daunting task. Over coffee, Bob scribbled on a napkin and determined that <span class="process-math">\(f(3)=7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(4)=9\text{,}\)</span> and on the basis of these calculations alone, he thought that it might just be possible that <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = 2n+1\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 1\text{.}\)</span> If this were true, he could simply report that <span class="process-math">\(f(10^{10})=2\cdot 10^{10}+1=20000000001\text{.}\)</span>
