<div class="para">For every graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{,}\)</span> it is obvious that <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG)\ge \omega(\bfG)\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, the inequality may be far from tight. Before showing how bad it can be, we need to introduce a more general version of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop_pigeon.html" title="Proposition 4.1: Pigeon Hole Principle">Pigeon Hole Principle</a>. Consider a function <span class="process-math">\(f\colon X\to Y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|X| = 2|Y|+1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(|X|&gt;|Y|\text{,}\)</span> the Pigeon Hole Principle as stated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop_pigeon.html" title="Proposition 4.1: Pigeon Hole Principle">PropositionÂ 4.1</a> only tells us that there are distinct <span class="process-math">\(x,x'\in X\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=f(x')\text{.}\)</span> However, we can say more here. Suppose that each element of <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> has at most two elements of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> mapped to it. Then adding up the number of elements of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> based on how many are mapped to each element of <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> would only allow <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to have (at most) <span class="process-math">\(2|Y|\)</span> elements. Thus, there must be <span class="process-math">\(y\in Y\)</span> so that there are three distinct elements <span class="process-math">\(x,x',x''\in X\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=f(x')=f(x'')=y\text{.}\)</span> This argument generalizes to give the following version of the Pigeon Hole Principle:</div>
