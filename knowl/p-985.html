<div class="para">If we had wanted to be absolutely precise earlier in the chapter, we would have referred to the generating functions we studied as <dfn class="terminology">ordinary generating functions</dfn> or even <dfn class="terminology">ordinary power series generating functions</dfn>. This is because there are other types of generating functions, based on other types of power series. In this section, we briefly introduce another type of generating function, the <dfn class="terminology">exponential generating function</dfn>. While an ordinary generating function has the form <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n} a_n x^n\text{,}\)</span> an exponential generating function is based on the power series for the exponential function <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the exponential generating function for the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{a_n\colon n\geq 0\}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\sum_n a_n x^n/n!\text{.}\)</span> In this section, we will see some ways we can use exponential generating functions to solve problems that we could not tackle with ordinary generating functions. However, we will only scratch the surface of the potential of this type of generating function. We begin with the most fundamental exponential generating function, in analogy with the ordinary generating function <span class="process-math">\(1/(1-x)\)</span> of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exam_genfunction_geom-series.html" title="Example 8.1">ExampleÂ 8.1</a>.</div>
