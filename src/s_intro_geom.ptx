    There are many problems in geometry that are innately combinatorial or for which combinatorial techniques shed light on the problem.
  </p>

  <example permid="STt">
    <p permid="LoU">
      In <xref ref="fig_linesregions" />, we show a family of <m>4</m> lines in the plane.
      Each pair of lines intersects and no point in the plane belongs to more than two lines.
      These lines determine<nbsp /><m>11</m> regions.
    </p>

    <p permid="rwd">
      Under these same restrictions,
      how many regions would a family of <m>8947</m> lines determine?
      Can different arrangements of lines determine different numbers of regions?
    </p>

    <p permid="DKv">
      Mandy says she has found a set of<nbsp /><m>882</m> points in the plane that determine exactly <m>752</m> lines.
      Tobias disputes her claim.
      Who is right?

      There are many different ways to draw a graph in the plane.
      Some drawings may have crossing edges while others don't.
      But sometimes, crossing edges must appear in any drawing.
      Consider the graph <m>G</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_crossingedges" />.

    <p permid="PYN">
      Can you redraw <m>G</m> without crossing edges?

    <p permid="wfW">
      Suppose Sam and Deborah were given a homework problem asking whether a particular graph on <m>2843952</m> vertices and <m>9748032</m> edges could be drawn without edge crossings.
      Deborah just looked at the number of vertices and the number of edges and said that the answer is <q>no.</q>
      Sam questions how she can be so certain<mdash />without looking more closely at the structure of the graph.
      Is there a way for Deborah to justify her definitive response?
