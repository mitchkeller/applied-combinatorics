<div class="para">There is a famous puzzle called the Towers of Hanoi that consists of three pegs and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> circular discs, all of different sizes. The discs start on the leftmost peg, with the largest disc on the bottom, the second largest on top of it, and so on, up to the smallest disc on top. The goal is to move the discs so that they are stacked in this same order on the rightmost peg. However, you are allowed to move only one disc at a time, and you are never able to place a larger disc on top of a smaller disc. Let <span class="process-math">\(t_n\)</span> denote the fewest moves (a move being taking a disc from one peg and placing it onto another) in which you can accomplish the goal. Determine an explicit formula for <span class="process-math">\(t_n\text{.}\)</span>
