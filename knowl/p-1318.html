<div class="para">So we have two probability spaces, both with sample space <span class="process-math">\(S=\{0,1,2,\dots,10,000\}\text{.}\)</span> For each, we have a random variable <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> the winning ticket number in the first situation, and the number of heads in the second. In each case, the expected value, <span class="process-math">\(E(X)\text{,}\)</span> of the random variable <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(5,000\text{.}\)</span> In the first case, we are not all that surprised at an outcome far from the expected value, while in the second, it seems intuitively clear that this is an extraordinary occurrence. The mathematical concept here is referred to as <dfn class="terminology">central tendency</dfn>, and it helps us to understand just how likely a random variable is to stray from its expected value.</div>
