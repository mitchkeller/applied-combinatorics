<div class="para">A sequence <span class="process-math">\((x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)\)</span> of vertices in a graph <span class="process-math">\(\GVE\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">walk</dfn> when <span class="process-math">\(x_ix_{i+1}\)</span> is an edge for each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,n-1\text{.}\)</span> Note that the vertices in a walk need not be distinct. On the other hand, if the vertices are distinct, then the sequence is called a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>, and often to emphasize where a path starts and ends, we will say that a sequence <span class="process-math">\((x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)\)</span> of distinct vertices is a path from <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, when <span class="process-math">\(n\ge3\text{,}\)</span> a path <span class="process-math">\((x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> distinct vertices is called a <dfn class="terminology">cycle</dfn> when <span class="process-math">\(x_1x_n\)</span> is also an edge in <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> It is customary to denote a path on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices by <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_n\)</span>, while <span class="process-math">\(\bfC_n\)</span> denotes a cycle on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices. The <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of a path or a cycle is the number of edges it contains. Therefore, the length of <span class="process-math">\(\bfP_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> and the length of <span class="process-math">\(\bfC_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_paths.html" title="Figure 5.4">Figure 5.4</a>, we show the paths of length at most <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> and in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_cycles.html" title="Figure 5.5">Figure 5.5</a>, we show the cycles of length at most <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span>
