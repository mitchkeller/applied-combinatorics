<div class="para">Suppose that we had three properties <span class="process-math">\(P_1,P_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_3\text{.}\)</span> How would we count the number of objects satisfying none of the properties? As before, we start by subtracting for each of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_3\text{.}\)</span> Now we have removed the objects satisfying both <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_2\)</span> twice, so we must add back <span class="process-math">\(N(\{1,2\})\text{.}\)</span> similarly, we must do this for the objects satisfying both <span class="process-math">\(P_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_3\)</span> and both <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_3\text{.}\)</span> Now let’s think about the objects satisfying all three properties. They’re counted in <span class="process-math">\(N(\emptyset)\text{,}\)</span> eliminated <em class="emphasis">three times</em> by the <span class="process-math">\(N(\{i\})\)</span> terms, and added back three times by the <span class="process-math">\(N(\{i,j\})\)</span> terms. Thus, they’re still being counted! Thus, we must yet subtract <span class="process-math">\(N(\{1,2,3\})\)</span> to get the desired number:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
N(\emptyset) - N(\{1\}) - N(\{2\}) - N(\{3\}) + N(\{1,2\}) +
N(\{2,3\}) + N(\{1,3\}) - N(\{1,2,3\}).
