<div class="para">The first step is to create the network, which we show in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flowapplications-network.html" title="Figure 14.8.(b)">FigureÂ 14.8.(b)</a>.  In this network, all capacities are <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> edges are directed from bottom to top, the first row of ten vertices is the <span class="process-math">\(x'_i\)</span> arranged consecutively with <span class="process-math">\(x'_1\)</span> at the left and <span class="process-math">\(x'_{10}\)</span> at the right, and the second row of ten vertices is the <span class="process-math">\(x''_i\)</span> in increasing order of index. To see how this network is constructed, notice that <span class="process-math">\(x_1\lt x_3\)</span> in the poset, so we have the directed edge <span class="process-math">\((x_1',x_3'')\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> is less than <span class="process-math">\(x_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_9\)</span> in the poset, leading to three directed edges leaving <span class="process-math">\(x_4'\)</span> in the network. As a third example, since <span class="process-math">\(x_9\)</span> is maximal in the poset, there are no directed edges leaving <span class="process-math">\(x_9'\text{.}\)</span>
