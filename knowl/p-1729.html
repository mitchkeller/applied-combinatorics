<div class="para">In this section, we present two examples intended to illustrate on-line problems in a combinatorial setting. Our first example involves graph coloring. As is customary in discussions of on-line algorithms, we consider a two-person game with the players called <dfn class="terminology">Assigner</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Builder</dfn>. The two players agree in advance on a class <span class="process-math">\(\cgC\)</span> of graphs, and the game is played in a series of rounds. At roundÂ <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> Builder presents a single vertex, and Assigner assigns it a color. At each subsequent rounds, Builder presents a new vertex, and provides complete information as to which of the preceding vertices are adjacent to it. In turn, Assigner must give the new vertex a color distinct from colors she has assigned previously to its neighbors.</div>
