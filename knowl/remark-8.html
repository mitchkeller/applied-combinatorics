<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Bob is quite taken with graphs associated with posets. He makes the following claims.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Only linear orders have paths as cover graphs.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A poset and its dual have the same cover graph and the same comparability graph.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Any two posets with the same cover graph have the same height and the same width.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Any two posets with the same comparability graph have the same height and the same width.</div></li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">Alice shrugs and says that Bob is right half the time. Which two assertions are correct?</div> <div class="para">Undeterred, Bob notes that the comparability graph shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_compincomp.html" title="Figure 6.9">Figure 6.9</a> is also an incomparability graph (for another poset). He goes on to posit that this is always true, i.e., whenever <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is the comparability graph of a poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\text{,}\)</span> there is another poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfQ\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\)</span> is the incomparability graph of <span class="process-math">\(\bfQ\text{.}\)</span> Alice says that Bob is right on the first count but she is not so sure about the second. Dave mumbles that they should take a look at the comparability graph of the third poset in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_constructposets.html" title="Figure 6.8">Figure 6.8</a>. This graph is not an incomparability graph. But in his typical befuddled manner, Dave doesn’t offer any justification for this statement. Can you help Alice and Bob to see why Dave is correct?</div> <div class="para">Bob is on a roll and he goes on to suggest that it is relatively easy to determine whether a graph is a comparability graph (he read it on the web), but he has a sense that determining whether a graph is a cover graph might be difficult.  Do you think he is right—on either count?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_posets_additional-concepts.html#remark-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
