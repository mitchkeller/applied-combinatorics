<div class="para">Despite Carlos’ hope that Bob could already see where this was heading, Bob eagerly asks for another augmenting path. Carlos promptly gives him <span class="process-math">\((S,A,B,T)\text{,}\)</span> which again has <span class="process-math">\(\delta=1\text{.}\)</span> Bob’s update gives them a flow of value <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> Before Carlos can suggest another augmenting path, Bob realizes what the problem is. He points out that Carlos can just give him <span class="process-math">\((S,B,A,T)\)</span> again, which will still have <span class="process-math">\(\delta=1\)</span> and result in the flow value increasing to <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> He says that they could keep alternating between those two augmenting paths, increasing the flow value by <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> each time, until they’d made <span class="process-math">\(2M\)</span> updates to finally have a flow of value <span class="process-math">\(2M\text{.}\)</span> Since the network only has four vertices and <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is very large, he realizes that using any old augmenting path is definitely not a good idea.</div>
