<div class="para">Suppose you are given a graph <span class="process-math">\(\bfG\text{.}\)</span> It’s starting to look like it is not easy to find an algorithm that answers the question “Is <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG)\leq t\text{?}\)</span>” It’s easy to verify a certificate (a proper coloring using at most <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> colors), but how could you even find a proper coloring, not to mention one with the fewest number of colors?  Similarly for the question “Is <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG)\geq k\text{?}\)</span>”, it is easy to verify a certificate. However, finding a maximum clique appears to be a very hard problem. Of course, since the gap between <span class="process-math">\(\chi(\bfG)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\omega(\bfG)\)</span> can be arbitrarily large, being able to find one value would not (generally) help in finding the value of the other. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for either of these problems, and many believe that no such algorithm exists. In this subsection, we look at one approach to finding chromatic number and see a case where it does work efficiently.</div>
