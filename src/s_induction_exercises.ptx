        A database uses record identifiers that are alphanumeric strings in which the <m>10</m> decimal digits and <m>26</m> upper-case letters are valid symbols.
        The criteria that define a valid record identifier are recursive.
        A valid record identifier of length <m>n\geq 2</m> can be constructed in the following ways:

        <ul permid="QWP">
          <li permid="dlh">
            beginning with any upper-case letter other than <m>D</m> and followed by any valid record identifier of length <m>n-1</m>;
          </li>

          <li permid="Jsq">
            beginning with <m>1C</m>, <m>2K</m>,
            or <m>7J</m> and followed by any valid record identifier of length <m>n-2</m>; or
          </li>

          <li permid="pzz">
            beginning with <m>D</m> and followed by any string of <m>n-1</m> decimal digits.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Let <m>r(n)</m> denote the number of valid record identifiers of length <m>n</m>.
        We take <m>r(0)=1</m> and note that <m>r(1) = 26</m>.
        Find a recursion for <m>r(n)</m> when <m>n\geq 2</m> and use it to compute <m>r(5)</m>.

        Consider a <m>1\times n</m> checkerboard.
        The squares of the checkerboard are to be painted white and gold,
        but no two consecutive squares may both be painted white.
        Let <m>p(n)</m> denote the number of ways to paint the checkerboard subject to this rule.
        Find a recursive formula for <m>p(n)</m> valid for <m>n\geq 3</m>.

    <statement>
      <p permid="yTl">
        A <m>2\times n</m> checkerboard is to be tiled using two types of tiles.
        The first tile is a <m>1\times 1</m> square tile.
        The second tile is called an <m>L</m>-tile and is formed by removing the upper-right
        <m>1\times 1</m> square from a <m>2\times 2</m> tile.
        The <m>L</m>-tiles can be used in any of the four ways they can be rotated.
        (That is, the <q>missing square</q>
        can be in any of four positions.)
        Let <m>t(n)</m> denote the number of tilings of the <m>2\times n</m> checkerboard using
        <m>1\times 1</m> tiles and <m>L</m>-tiles.
