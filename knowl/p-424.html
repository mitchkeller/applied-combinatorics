<div class="para">The second of the three problems is a bit more challenging. Now it seems that we must consider the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-element subsets of a set of size <span class="process-math">\(10,000\text{.}\)</span>  There are <span class="process-math">\(C(10,000,3)\)</span> such sets. On the one hand, testing three numbers to see if their sum is <span class="process-math">\(143,297\)</span> is very easy, but there are lots and lots of sets to test. Note that <span class="process-math">\(C(10,000,3)=166,616,670,000\text{,}\)</span> and not too many computers will handle this many operations. Moreover, if the list is expanded to a million numbers, then we have more than <span class="process-math">\(10^{17}\)</span> triples to test, and that’s off the table with today’s hardware.</div>
