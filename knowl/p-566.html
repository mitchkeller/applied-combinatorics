<div class="para">To see why <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{3,3}\)</span> is not planar, we’ll have to return to Euler’s formula, and we again work with edge-face pairs. For <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{3,3}\text{,}\)</span> we see that every edge would have to be part of the boundary of two faces, and faces are bounded by cycles. Also, since the graph is bipartite, there are no odd cycles. Thus, counting edge-face pairs from the edge perspective, we see that there are <span class="process-math">\(2m = 18\)</span> pairs. If we let <span class="process-math">\(f_k\)</span> be the number of faces bounded by a cycle of length <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f= f_4 + f_6\text{.}\)</span> Thus, counting edge-face pairs from the face perspective, there are <span class="process-math">\(4f_4 + 6f_6\)</span> pairs. From Euler’s formula, we see that the number of faces <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> so then <span class="process-math">\(4f_4+6f_6\geq 20\text{.}\)</span> But from our count of edge-face pairs, we have <span class="process-math">\(2m=4f_4+6f_6\text{,}\)</span> giving <span class="process-math">\(18\geq 20\text{,}\)</span> which is clearly absurd. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{3,3}\)</span> is not planar.</div>
