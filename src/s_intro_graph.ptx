  <title>Combinatorics and Graph Theory</title>
  <p>A <term>graph</term> <m>G</m> consists of a <term>vertex</term> set   <m>V</m> and a collection <m>E</m> of <m>2</m>-element subsets of   <m>V</m>. Elements of <m>E</m> are called <term>edges</term>. In our course, we will (almost always) use the convention that <m>V=\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>. With this convention, graphs can be described <em>precisely</em> with a text file:
                  <ol>
    <li><p>The first line of the file contains a single integer <m>n</m>, the number of vertices in the graph.</p></li>
    <li><p>Each of the remaining lines of the file contains a pair of  distinct integers and specifies an edge of the graph.</p></li>
  
                  </ol>
                </p>

  <p>We illustrate this convention in <xref ref="fig_graphdata"  /> with a text file and the diagram for the graph<nbsp /><m>G</m> it defines.</p>

  <p>Much of the notation and terminology for graphs is quite natural. See if you can make sense out of the following statements which apply to the graph <m>G</m> defined above:
                  <ol>
    <li><p><m>G</m> has <m>9</m> vertices and <m>10</m> edges.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\{2,6\}</m> is an edge.</p></li>
    <li><p>Vertices <m>5</m> and <m>9</m> are adjacent.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\{5,4\}</m> is not an edge.</p></li>
    <li><p>Vertices <m>3</m> and <m>7</m> are not adjacent.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>P = (4, 3,1, 7,9,5)</m> is a path 
    of length<nbsp /><m>5</m> from vertex <m>4</m> to vertex<nbsp /><m>5</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>C=(5,9,7,1)</m> is cycle of length<nbsp /><m>4</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>G</m> is disconnected and has two components.
    One of the components has vertex set <m>\{2,6,8\}</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\{1,5,7\}</m> is a triangle.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\{1,7,5,9\}</m> is a clique of size<nbsp /><m>4</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\{4,2,8,5\}</m> is an independent set of
    size<nbsp /><m>4</m>.</p></li>
  
                  </ol>
                </p>
  
  <p>Equipped only with this little bit of background material, we are already able to pose a number of interesting and challenging problems.</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the graph <m>G</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_connectedgraph"  />.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_connectedgraph" >

<image width="81%" source="images/3012-fig17" />
</figure>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>What is the largest <m>k</m> for which <m>G</m> has a path
        of length<nbsp /><m>k</m>?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the largest <m>k</m> for which <m>G</m> has a cycle 
        of length<nbsp /><m>k</m>?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the largest <m>k</m> for which <m>G</m> has a clique
        of size<nbsp /><m>k</m>?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the largest <m>k</m> for which <m>G</m> has an
        independent set of size<nbsp /><m>k</m>?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the shortest path from vertex<nbsp /><m>7</m> to
        vertex<nbsp /><m>6</m>?</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
Suppose we gave the class a text data file for a graph
on <m>1500</m> vertices and asked whether the graph contains
a cycle of length at least <m>500</m>. Raoul says yes and
Carla says no. How do we decide who is right?
</p>

<p>
Suppose instead we asked whether the graph has a clique of
size<nbsp /><m>500</m>. Helene says that she doesn't think so, but isn't
certain. Is it reasonable that her classmates insist that
she make up her mind, one way or the other? Is determining whether
this graph has a clique of size<nbsp /><m>500</m> harder, easier or
more or less the same as determining whether
it has a cycle of size<nbsp /><m>500</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>
We will frequently study problems in which graphs
arise in a very natural manner. Here's an example.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex_radiostations">
<statement>
<p>
In <xref ref="fig_radiostations"  />, we show the location of some radio stations in the
plane, together with a scale indicating a distance of<nbsp /><m>200</m> miles.
Radio stations that are closer than<nbsp /><m>200</m> miles apart must broadcast
on different frequencies to avoid interference.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_radiostations" >
<caption>Radio Stations</caption>
<image width="79%" source="images/3012-fig4" />
</figure>
<p>
We've shown that<nbsp /><m>6</m> different frequencies are enough.
Can you do better?
</p>

<p>
Can you find<nbsp /><m>4</m> stations each of which is within
<m>200</m> miles of the other<nbsp /><m>3</m>? Can you find <m>8</m> stations each of is more
than <m>200</m> miles away from the other<nbsp /><m>7</m>? Is there a natural
way to define a graph associated with this problem?
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
How big must an applied combinatorics class be so that there are
either (a)<nbsp />six students with each pair having taken at least one
other class together, or (b)<nbsp />six students with each pair together
in a class for the first time. Is this really a hard problem or
can we figure it out in just a few minutes, scribbling on a napkin?
