<div class="para">A family of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> lines is drawn in the plane with (1) each pair of lines crossing and (2) no three lines crossing in the same point.  Let <span class="process-math">\(r(n)\)</span> denote the number of regions into which the plane is partitioned by these lines. Evidently, <span class="process-math">\(r(1)=2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r(2)=4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r(3)=7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r(4)=11\text{.}\)</span> To determine <span class="process-math">\(r(n)\)</span> for all positive integers, it is enough to note that <span class="process-math">\(r(1)=2\text{,}\)</span> and when <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r(n)=n+r(n-1)\text{.}\)</span> This formula follows from the observation that if we label the lines as <span class="process-math">\(L_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L_2, \dots, L_n\text{,}\)</span> then the <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> points on line <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> where it crosses the other lines in the family divide <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> segments, two of which are infinite. Each of these segments is associated with a region determined by the first <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> lines that has now been subdivided into two, giving us <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> more regions than were determined by <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> lines. This situation is illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_induction_lines-regions.html" title="Figure 3.4">Figure 3.4</a>, where the line containing the three dots is <span class="process-math">\(L_4\text{.}\)</span> The other lines divide it into four segments, which then divide larger regions to create regions <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(8\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(9\text{.}\)</span>
