<div class="para">Appel and Haken’s proof of the Four Color Theorem was at a minimum unsatisfactory for many mathematicians, and to some it simply wasn’t a proof. These mathematicians felt that the using a computer to check various cases was simply too uncertain; how could you be certain that the code that checked the 1,482 “unavoidable configurations” didn’t contain any logic errors? In fact, there were several mistakes found in the cases analyzed, but none were found to be fatal flaws. In 1989, Appel and Haken published a 741-page tome entitled <span class="booktitle">Every Planar Map is Four Colorable</span> which provided corrections to all known flaws in their original argument. This still didn’t satisfy many, and in the early 1990’s a team consisting of Neil Robertson from The Ohio State University; Daniel P. Sanders, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology; Paul Seymour of Bellcore; and Robin Thomas from Georgia Tech announced a new proof of the Four Color Theorem. However, it still required the use of computers. The proof did gain more widespread acceptance than that of Appel and Haken, in part because the new proof used fewer than half (<span class="process-math">\(633\)</span>) of the number of configurations the Appel-Haken proof used and the computer code was provided online for anyone to verify. While still unsatisfactory to many, the proof by Robertson, et al. was generally accepted, and today the issue of the Four Color Theorem has largely been put to rest. However, many still wonder if anyone will ever find a proof of this simple statement that does not require the assistance of a computer.</div>
