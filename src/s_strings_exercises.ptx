        Matt is designing a website authentication system.
        He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers,
        and symbols.
        However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears.
        He decides that valid passwords for his system will begin with three letters
        (uppercase and lowercase both allowed),
        followed by two digits, followed by one of <m>10</m> symbols,
        followed by two uppercase letters,
        followed by a digit, followed by one of <m>10</m> symbols.
        How many different passwords are there for his website system?
        How does this compare to the total number of strings of length <m>10</m> made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters,
        decimal digits, and <m>10</m> symbols?

        A small-town bank robber is driving his getaway car from the bank he just robbed to his hideout.

        Assuming that the bank robber does not want to get arrested and drives only on streets and avenues,

        Buzz, the Georgia Tech mascot,

        There's also a pair of tigers
        (mother and cub)
        from Clemson who live <m>1</m> block east and <m>2</m> blocks north of Uga VIII, and they're known for setting traps for Buzz.

        What is the largest number of consecutive days on which Buzz can make the trip to visit Thundar without reusing a route (you may assume the routes taken by Buzz only go east and north)?
