<div class="para">Suppose we are scanning from a labeled vertex <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> with potential <span class="process-math">\(p(u)&gt;0\text{.}\)</span>  From <span class="process-math">\(u\text{,}\)</span> we consider the unlabeled neighbors of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> in pseudo-alphabetic order.  Now suppose that we are looking at a neighbor <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> with the edge <span class="process-math">\((u,v)\)</span> belonging to the network.  This means that the edge is directed from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span>  If <span class="process-math">\(e=(u,v)\)</span> is not full, then we label the vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> with the triple <span class="process-math">\((u,+,p(v))\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p(v)=\min\{p(u),c(e)-\phi(e)\}\text{.}\)</span> We use this definition since the flow cannot be increased by more than the prior potential or the spare capacity on <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> Note that the potential <span class="process-math">\(p(v)\)</span> is positive since <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is the minimum of two positive numbers.</div>
