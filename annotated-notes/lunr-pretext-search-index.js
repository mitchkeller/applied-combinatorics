How many license plates start with a vowel followed by a consonant or end with a -digit number divisible by ?    We have to be careful here, because if we try adding the answers to the first two parts together, then we have counted license plates such as EGA105 twice, since this is a vowel-consonant plate and a divisible by 5 plate. We can deal with this by subtracting the answer to the third part, as the plates that are both vowel-consonant plates and divisible by 5 plates are exactly those that are counted twice.

A grid of dots. There are 13 columns of dots and 8 rows of dots. The dot in the lower left corner is labeled . The dot in the upper right corner is labeled . There is a path marked on the grid between these dots. The path moves only to the right and up. It consists of three moves to the right, two moves up, one move right, one move up, one move right, three moves up, five moves right, one move up, one move right, one move up, and two moves right.    We need 13 H's and 8 V's to move from to . Thus, we need a string of length 21 that has exactly 13 H's and exactly 8 V's. There are such strings, so this is also the number of lattice paths.      The town of Mascotville is laid out as a grid. There are seven parallel streets ( through ) that run north-south and five parallel avenues ( through ) that run east-west.     Buzz starts at the intersection of Street and Avenue and wants to get to Bucky's burrow at the intersection of Street and Avenue traveling only on streets\/avenues, and always moving toward Bucky's burrow. How many ways can he do this?           The Varsity is at the intersection of Street and Avenue. How many ways can Buzz get to Bucky's burrow if he insists on stopping at The Varsity?           Suppose Buzz is put on a diet and prohibited from eating at The Varsity. He knows if he goes by it, he'll stop and eat, so he must avoid it completely. How many ways are there for him to get to Bucky's burrow that avoid The Varsity?    We count all the lattice paths and subtract those that go through The Varsity, so we have .      How many lattice paths are there from to that do not cross the line ? (Lattice paths are allowed to touch the line.)   We will count the number of bad lattice paths (those that cross ) and subtract from the total number of lattice paths, which is .   Peer instruction question 1   We establish a 1-1 correspondence between all lattice paths from to and the bad lattice paths from to .   Take a bad lattice path from to and find the first place that it crosses the line . After that point, change every H into a V (and vice versa). At this moment, there must be H's and V's for some in the first part of the string and thus H's and V's in the second part of the string. After the swap, we thus have H's and V's. Thus, this new lattice path is one from to .   Pause for Peer Instruction question 2     Every lattice path from to must cross the line because it starts on the line and ends above it. Therefore, there is a first time such a lattice path is above the line. Do the H\/V swap after that point, and now we have a lattice path that ends at but that is bad because we preserved being above the line.   This means there are bad lattice paths, so the total number of good lattice paths is . We call this number the Catalan number        Find a - correspondence between the set of good lattice paths and each of the following sets:     Sequences of  's and  's in which the sum of the first terms is non-negative for all .

The second term on the right-hand side counts the -element subsets of that do not contain 1, since if we have decided that 1 is not in the subset, we have only elements to pick from but we must pick of them. Every -element subset must either contain 1 or not contain 1, so this has counted all of the -element subsets and therefore the sum equals .

When adding the -th line, this new line is cut exactly once by each of the existing lines. The -th line is thus cut into pieces.

Two graphs   These graphs are isomorphic. One possible isomorphism is shown below.                       Two graphs   These graphs are not isomorphic. To see why they are not, we try to construct an isomorphism. Since and are the only vertices of degree , any isomorphism would have to pair them. This then forces and , as the unique neighbors of the vertices of degree to be paired. However, all neighbors of have degree , while has a neighbor ( ) of degree . Another independent reason would be that and are the unique vertices of degree in these graphs, so they would have to be paired. However, has two neighbors of degree , while has a neighbor of degree . As a third independent reason, notice that in the left graph, the vertex of degree and the vertex of degree are distance 3 apart. However, in the right graph, the vertex of degree and the vertex of degree are distance 2 apart.     On the Complexity of Graph Isomorphism   The question we would like to answer algorithmically is Given two graphs and , is isomorphic to ? The two most-studied classes of computational problems are and , with a focus on -complete problems. The problems in have efficient algorithms, by which we roughly mean the number of operations an algorithm takes is polynomial in the size of the input (usually number of vertices for graphs). The -complete problems are believed to be computationally intractable but must all be of a type where a yes or no answer can be readily verified. (For instance, if I give you a function that I claim is an isomorphism, it's fast to verify this fact.) Most problems that fit this framework have been shown to be in or to be -complete. However, graph isomorphism has not shown to be either. In fact, it is often considered to be the leading candidate for a problem that is neither in nor -complete.   The First Theorem of Graph Theory aka The Handshaking Lemma   Let denote the degree of vertex in graph . Then .    The summation counts an edge twice: once when and once when .         In any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even.    Adding up an odd number of odd numbers gives an odd number, and the sum would remain odd no matter how many even numbers are added in.       Walk   so that for .    Path  Walk with no repeated vertices.    Cycle  Path with for which is also an edge.           A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.  A vertex in a tree is called a leaf provided that .        Every tree on at least two vertices has at least two leaves.      If is a tree, then for every pair of distinct vertices , there exists a unique path from to in .          With your neighbors, use mathematical induction to prove that every tree on vertices has exactly edges.  How many edges would an -vertex forest consisting of trees have?       For the base case, when , the tree has only one vertex and thus no edges. Since , we have the desired relationship. Now assume that for some , every tree with vertices has exactly edges. Let be a tree with vertices. The tree has a leaf . Form from by deleting and its edge. Then has vertices, so by the induction hypothesis, has edges. However, has one more edge (incident with ) than , so has edges.   Notice in the proof above that it was essential to delete a leaf, as otherwise we would not know that the new graph is still a tree (it might be a forest).  A forest is a graph with no cycles, meaning that each component of a forest is itself a tree. Thus, we would need to have edges.     "
