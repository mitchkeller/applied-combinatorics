The first is that <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_genfunction_ineq-clean.html" title="Exercise 8.8.7">Exercise 8.8.7</a> has been modified to make the computations involved cleaner. We have preserved the exercise that was previously in this position as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_genfunction_ineq-messy.html" title="Exercise 8.8.27">Exercise 8.8.27</a> and added a hint.
