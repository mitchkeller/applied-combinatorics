<div class="para">In this section, we will use generating functions to enumerate the a certain type of trees. In doing this, we will see how generating functions can be used in solving a <em class="emphasis">nonlinear</em> recurrence equation. We will also make a connection to a counting sequence we encountered back in <a href="ch_strings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients">ChapterÂ 2</a>. To do all of this, we must introduce a bit of terminology. A tree is <dfn class="terminology">rooted</dfn> if we have designated a special vertex called its <dfn class="terminology">root</dfn>. We will always draw our trees with the root at the top and all other vertices below it. An <dfn class="terminology">unlabeled tree</dfn> is one in which we do not make distinctions based upon names given to the vertices. For our purposes, a <dfn class="terminology">binary tree</dfn> is one in which each vertex has <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> children, and an <dfn class="terminology">ordered tree</dfn> is one in which the children of a vertex have some ordering (first, second, third, etc.). Since we will be focusing on rooted, unlabeled, binary, ordered trees (RUBOTs for short), we will call the two children of vertices that have children the <dfn class="terminology">left</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">right</dfn> children.</div>
