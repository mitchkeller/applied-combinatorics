    <title>An Introduction to Combinatorics</title>


    <introduction>
        <p>
            As we hope you will sense right from the beginning, we believe that combinatorial mathematics is one of the most fascinating and captivating subjects on the planet. Combinatorics is <em>very</em> concrete and has a wide range of applications, but it also has an intellectually appealing theoretical side. Our goal is to give you a taste of both. In order to begin, we want to develop, through a series of examples, a feeling for what types of problems combinatorics addresses.
