<div class="para">We close this section with an example of how to take a Prüfer code and use it to construct a labeled tree. Consider the string <span class="process-math">\(\bfs=75531\)</span> as a Prüfer code. Then the tree <span class="process-math">\(\bfT\)</span> corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(\bfs\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> vertices, and its leaves are labeled <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span> The inductive step in our proof attaches the vertex labeled <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> to the vertex labeled <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> in the tree <span class="process-math">\(\bfT'\)</span> with Prüfer code <span class="process-math">\(5531\)</span> and vertex labels <span class="process-math">\(\{1,3,4,5,6,7\}\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is used to label the last vertex added. What are the leaves of <span class="process-math">\(\bfT'\text{?}\)</span> The symbols in <span class="process-math">\(\{4,6,7\}\)</span> do not appear in <span class="process-math">\(5531\text{,}\)</span> so they must be the labels of leaves, and the construction says that we would attach the vertex labeled <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> to the vertex labeled <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> in the tree we get by induction. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_prufer-code-reverse.html" title="Figure 5.44">Figure 5.44</a>, we show how this recursive process continues.</div>
