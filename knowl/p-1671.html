<div class="para">Now let’s see how the number of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-colorings of the square fixed by a permutation can be determined from its cycle structure and associated monomial. If <span class="process-math">\(\pi(i)=j\text{,}\)</span> then we know that for <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> to fix a coloring <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> vertices <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> must be colored the same in <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the second vertex in a cycle must have the same color as the first. But then the third vertex must have the same color as the second, which is the same color as the first. In fact, all vertices appearing in a cycle of <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> must have the same color in <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> fixes <span class="process-math">\(C\text{!}\)</span>  Since we are coloring with the two colors white and gold, we can choose to color the points of each cycle uniformly white or gold. For example, for the permutation <span class="process-math">\(v=(12)(34)\)</span> to fix a coloring of the square, vertices <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> must be colored the same color (<span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> choices) and vertices <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> must be colored the same color (<span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> choices). Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 2=4\)</span> colorings fixed by <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> Since there are two choices for how to uniformly color the elements of a cycle, letting <span class="process-math">\(x_i=2\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> in the monomial associated with <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> gives the number of colorings fixed by <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_square-cycles.html" title="Figure 15.10">Figure 15.10</a>, the “Fixed colorings” column gives the number of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-colorings of the square fixed by each permutation. Before, we obtained this manually by considering the action of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\)</span> on the set of all <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> colorings. Now we only need the cycle notation and the monomials that result from it to derive this!</div>
