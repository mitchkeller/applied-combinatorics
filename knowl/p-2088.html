<div class="para">Amanda and Bilal, both students at a nearby university, have been studying rational numbers that have large blocks of repeating digits in their decimal expansions.  Amanda reports that she has found two positive integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n\lt 500\)</span> for which the decimal expansion of the rational number <span class="process-math">\(m/n\)</span> has a block of 1961 digits which repeats indefinitely. Not to be outdone, Bilal brags that he has found such a pair <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> of positive integers with <span class="process-math">\(t\lt 300\)</span> for which the decimal expansion of <span class="process-math">\(s/t\)</span> has a block of <span class="process-math">\(7643\)</span> digits which repeats indefinitely. Bilal should be (politely) told to do his arithmetic more carefully, as there is no such pair of positive integers (<em class="emphasis">Why</em>?). On the other hand, Amanda may in fact be correctâ€”although, if she has done her work with more attention to detail, she would have reported that the decimal expansion of <span class="process-math">\(m/n\)</span> has a smaller block of repeating digits (<em class="emphasis">Why</em>?).</div>
