<div class="para">From these examples, you should start to see a pattern emerging that leads to a more general setting. In full generality, we will consider a set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and a family <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}=\{P_1,P_2,\dots,P_m\}\)</span> of <dfn class="terminology">properties</dfn>. We intend that for every <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and each <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,m\text{,}\)</span> either <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(P_i\)</span> or it does not. There is no ambiguity. Ultimately, we are interested in determining the number of elements of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> which satisfy <em class="emphasis">none</em> of the properties in <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_inclusion-exclusion_students.html" title="Example 7.1">Example 7.1</a>, we could have made property <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> “is a computer science major” and property <span class="process-math">\(P_2\)</span> “is male”. Then the number of students satisfying <em class="emphasis">neither</em> <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(P_2\)</span> would be the number of female students majoring in something other than computer science, exactly the number we were asked to determine. What would the properties <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_2\)</span> be for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa_inclusion-exclusion_int-solns.html" title="Example 7.3">Example 7.3</a>?</div>
