<div class="para">Now that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in <span class="process-math">\(S_4^{(2)}\text{,}\)</span> the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group <span class="process-math">\(S_4\text{.}\)</span> A permutation consisting of a single <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle begins with <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and then has <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> in any of the <span class="process-math">\(3!=6\)</span> possible orders, so there are <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> such permutations. For permutations consisting of a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycle and a <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycle, there are <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> ways to choose the element for the <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycle and then <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ways to arrange the other three as a <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles and a <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle, there are <span class="process-math">\(C(4,2)=6\)</span> ways to choose the two elements for the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle. Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> such permutations. For a permutation to consist of two <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles, there are <span class="process-math">\(C(4,2)=6\)</span> ways to choose two elements for the first <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle. The other two are then put in the second <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the “other two.” Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> permutations consisting of two <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles. Finally, only <span class="process-math">\(\iota\)</span> consists of four <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-cycles.</div>
