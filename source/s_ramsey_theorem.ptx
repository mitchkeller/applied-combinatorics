    <p>By this time, you are probably not surprised to see that there is a very general form of Ramsey's theorem. We have a bounded number of bins or colors and we are placing the subsets of a fixed size into these categories. The conclusion is that there is a large set which is treated uniformly.

    <p>
        Here's the formal statement.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_genramsey">
        <idx><h>Ramsey's theorem</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> be positive integers and let <m>\mathbf{h}=(h_1,h_2,\dots,h_r)</m> be a string of integers with <m>h_i\ge s</m> for each <m>i=1,2,\dots,s</m>.  Then there exists a least positive integer <m>R(s:h_1,h_2,\dots,h_r)</m> so that if <m>n\ge n_0</m> and <m>\phi:C([n],s]\longrightarrow [r]</m> is any function, then there exists an integer <m>\alpha\in[r]</m> and a subset <m>H_\alpha\subseteq [n]</m> with <m>|H_\alpha|=h_\alpha</m> so that <m>\phi(S)=\alpha</m> for every <m>S\in C(H_\alpha, s)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>We don't include the proof of this general statement here, but the more ambitious students may attempt it on their own. Note that the case <m>s=1</m> is just the <xref ref="prop_pigeon" text="title" />, while the case <m>s=r=2</m> is just <xref ref="thm_graphramsey" text="title" />. An argument using double induction is required for the proof in the general case. The first induction is on <m>r</m> and the second is on <m>s</m>.
