<div class="para">At this point, you’re probably asking yourself “So what?” We’ve invested a fair amount of effort to establish that <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\bfK_{3,3}\)</span> are nonplanar. Clearly any graph that contains them is also nonplanar, but there are a lot of graphs, so you might think that we could be at this forever. Fortunately, we won’t be, since at its core, planarity really comes down to just these two graphs, as we shall soon see.</div>
