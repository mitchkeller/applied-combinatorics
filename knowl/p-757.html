<div class="para">As we shall soon see, interval orders can be characterized succinctly in terms of forbidden subposets. Before stating this characterization, we need to introduce a bit more notation. By <span class="process-math">\(\bfn\)</span> (for <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 1\)</span> an integer), we mean the chain with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> points.  More precisely, we take the ground set to be <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(i \lt j\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\bfn\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(i\lt j\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\ints\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\PXP\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\QYQ\)</span> are posets with <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> disjoint, then <span class="process-math">\(\bfP+\bfQ\)</span> is the poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfR=(X\cup Y,R)\)</span> where the partial order is given by <span class="process-math">\(z\leq w\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> if and only if (a) <span class="process-math">\(z,w\in X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\leq w\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> or (b) <span class="process-math">\(z,w\in Y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\leq w\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\bfn+\bfm\)</span> consists of a chain with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> points and a chain with <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> points and no comparabilities between them. In particular, <span class="process-math">\(\bftwo+\bftwo\)</span> can be viewed as a four-point poset with ground set <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\lt b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\lt d\)</span> as the only relations (other than those required to make the relation reflexive).</div>
