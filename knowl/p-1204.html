<div class="para">The recurrence equations of the two examples in this section can both be solved using the techniques we studied earlier in the chapter. One potential benefit to the generating function approach for nonhomogeneous equations is that it does not require determining an appropriate form for the particular solution. However, the method of generating functions often requires that the resulting generating function be expanded using partial fractions. Both approaches have positives and negatives, so unless instructed to use a specific method, you should choose whichever seems most appropriate for a given situation. In the next section, we will see a recurrence equation that is most easily solved using generating functions because it is nonlinear.</div>
