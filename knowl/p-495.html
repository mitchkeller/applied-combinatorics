<div class="para">Consider a graph in which the vertices represent cities and the edges represent highways. Certain pairs of cities are joined by an edge while other pairs are not. The graph may or may not be connected (although a disconnected graph is likely to result in disgruntled commuters). However, certain aspects of real highway networks are not captured by this model. First, between two nearby cities, there can actually be several interconnecting highways, and traveling on one of them is fundamentally different from traveling on another. This leads to the concept of <dfn class="terminology">multiple edges</dfn>, i.e., allowing for more than one edge between two adjacent vertices. Also, we could have a highway which leaves a city, goes through the nearby countryside and the returns to the same city where it originated. This leads to the concept of a <dfn class="terminology">loop</dfn>, i.e., an edge with both end points being the same vertex. Also, we can allow for more than one loop with the same end point.</div>
