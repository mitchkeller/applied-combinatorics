<div class="para">On the other hand, you might ask whether <span class="process-math">\(\pi(n)\)</span> tends to infinity as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> grows larger and larger. The answer is yes, and hereâ€™s a simple and quite classic argument. Suppose to the contrary that there were only <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> primes, where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer. Suppose these <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> primes are listed in increasing order as <span class="process-math">\(p_1\lt p_2\lt \dots\lt p_k\text{,}\)</span> and consider the number <span class="process-math">\(n=1+p_1p_2\cdots p_k\text{.}\)</span>  Then <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is not divisible by any of these primes, and it is larger than <span class="process-math">\(p_k\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is either a prime number larger than <span class="process-math">\(p_k\)</span> or divisible by a prime number larger than <span class="process-math">\(p_k\text{.}\)</span>
