<div class="para">Before we get into the molecular structure of xylenol, we need to discuss the permutation group that will act on a benzene ring. Much like with our example of coloring the vertices of the square, we find that there are rotations and flips at play here. In fact, the group we require is the dihedral group of the hexagon, <span class="process-math">\(D_{12}\text{.}\)</span> If we number the six carbon atoms in clockwise order as <span class="process-math">\(1,2,\dots,6\text{,}\)</span> then we find that the clockwise rotation by <span class="process-math">\(60^\circ\)</span> corresponds to the permutation <span class="process-math">\(r=(123456)\text{.}\)</span> The other rotations are the higher powers of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_benzene.html" title="Figure 15.13">Figure 15.13</a>. The flip across the vertical axis is the permutation <span class="process-math">\(f=(16)(25)(34)\text{.}\)</span> The remaining elements of <span class="process-math">\(D_{12}\)</span> (other than the identity <span class="process-math">\(\iota\)</span>) can all be realized as some rotation followed by this flip. The full list of permutations is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab_polya_benzene.html" title="Figure 15.13">Figure 15.13</a>, where each permutation is accompanied by the monomial it contributes to the cycle index.</div>
