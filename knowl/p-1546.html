<div class="para">Since this network is really small, it was easy for Bob to find the maximum flow. However, Bob and Carlos agree that “eyeballing” is not an approach that scales well to larger networks, so they need to have an approach to finding that flow using augmenting paths. Bob tells Carlos to give him an augmenting path, and he’ll do the updating. Carlos suggests the augmenting path <span class="process-math">\((S,A,B,T)\text{,}\)</span> and Bob determines that <span class="process-math">\(\delta=1\)</span> for this augmenting path. He updates the network (starting from the zero flow, i.e., with <span class="process-math">\(\phi(e)=0\)</span> for every edge <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span>) and it now has value <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Bob asks Carlos for another augmenting path, so Carlos gives him <span class="process-math">\((S,B,A,T)\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\((B,A)\)</span> is backward, but that doesn’t phase Bob. He performs the update, obtaining a flow of value <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\((A,B)\)</span> empty again.</div>
