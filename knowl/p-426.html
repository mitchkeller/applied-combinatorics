<div class="para">The third of the three problems is different. First, it seems to be much harder.  There are <span class="process-math">\(2^{n-1}\)</span> complementary pairs of subsets of a set of size <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and one of these involves the empty set and the entire set. But that leaves <span class="process-math">\(2^{n-1}-1\)</span> pairs to test. Each of these tests is not all that tough. A netbook can easily report whether a two subsets have the same sum, even when the two sets form a partition of a set of size <span class="process-math">\(10,000\text{,}\)</span> but there are approximately <span class="process-math">\(10^{3000}\)</span> partitions to test and no piece of hardware on the planet will touch that assignment.  And if we go up to a set of size <span class="process-math">\(1,000,000\text{,}\)</span> then the combined computing power of all the machines on earth won’t get the job done.</div>
