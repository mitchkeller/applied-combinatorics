<div class="para">The labeling algorithm involves a scan from a <em class="emphasis">labeled</em> vertex <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span>  As the vertices are labeled, they determine another linear order.  The source will always be the first vertex in this order.  After that, the order in which vertices are labeled will change with time.  But the important rule is that we scan vertices in the order that they are labeled—until we label the sink.  If for example, the initial scan—always done from the source—results in labels being applied to vertices <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> then we next scan from vertex <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span>  If that scan results in vertices <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> being labeled, then we next scan from <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> as it was labeled before <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> even though <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> precedes <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> in the pseudo-alphabetic order.  This aspect of the algorithm results in a <em class="emphasis">breadth-first</em> search of the vertices looking for ways to label previously unlabeled vertices.</div>
