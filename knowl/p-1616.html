<div class="para">Now that we’ve gone over the part you already knew how to do, we need to discuss how to translate this network flow and cut into a chain partition and an antichain. If there is a unit of flow on an edge <span class="process-math">\((x_i',x_j'')\text{,}\)</span> then a good first instinct is to place <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_j\)</span> in the same chain of a chain partition. To be able to do this successfully, of course, we need to ensure that this won’t result in two incomparable points being placed in a chain. A way to see that everything works as desired is to think of starting with <span class="process-math">\((x_i',x_j'')\)</span> and then looking for flow leaving <span class="process-math">\(x_j'\text{.}\)</span> If there is, it goes to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x_k''\text{,}\)</span> so we may add <span class="process-math">\(x_k\)</span> to the chain since <span class="process-math">\(x_i\lt x_j\lt x_k\text{.}\)</span> Continue in this manner until reaching a vertex in the network that does not have any flow leaving it. Then see if <span class="process-math">\(x_i''\)</span> has flow coming into it. If it does, it’s from a vertex <span class="process-math">\(x_m'\)</span> that can be added since <span class="process-math">\(x_m\lt x_i\lt x_j\text{.}\)</span>
