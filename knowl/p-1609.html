<div class="para">In <a href="ch_posets.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Partially Ordered Sets">Chapter 6</a>, we discussed <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_dilworth.html" title="Theorem 6.17: Dilworth’s Theorem">Dilworth’s Theorem</a>, which told us that for any poset <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> of width <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> there is a partition of <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> but no fewer, chains. However, we were only able to devise an algorithm to find this chain partition (and a maximum antichain) in the special case where <span class="process-math">\(\bfP\)</span> was an interval order. Now, through the magic of network flows, we will be able to devise an efficient algorithm that works in general for all posets. However, to do so, we will require a slightly more complicated network than we devised in the previous section.</div>
