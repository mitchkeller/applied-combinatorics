<div class="para">The way a permutation rearranges the elements of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is central to Pólya’s enumeration theorem. A proper choice of representation for a permutation is very important here, so let’s discuss how permutations can be represented. One way to represent a permutation <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> is as a <span class="process-math">\(2\times n\)</span> matrix in which the first row represents the domain and the second row represents <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> by putting <span class="process-math">\(\pi(i)\)</span> in position <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> For example,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig_polya_perm-digraph.html">
\begin{equation*}
\pi=
\begin{pmatrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5\\
2 \amp  4 \amp  3 \amp  5 \amp  1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">is the permutation of <span class="process-math">\([5]\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\pi(1) =2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi(2)=4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi(3)=3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi(4) = 5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi(5) = 1\text{.}\)</span> This notation is rather awkward and provides only the most basic information about the permutation. A more compact (and more useful for our purposes) notation is known as <dfn class="terminology">cycle notation</dfn>. One way to visualize how the cycle notation is constructed is by constructing a digraph from a permutation <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\([n]\text{.}\)</span> The digraph has <span class="process-math">\([n]\)</span> as its vertex set and a directed edge from <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\pi(i) = j\text{.}\)</span> (Here we allow a directed edge from a vertex to itself if <span class="process-math">\(\pi(i) = i\text{.}\)</span>) The digraph corresponding to the permutation <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> from above is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_polya_perm-digraph.html" title="Figure 15.3">Figure 15.3</a>.</div>
