<div class="para">One of the most well-known recurrences arises from a simple story. Suppose that a scientist introduces a pair of newborn rabbits to an isolated island. This species of rabbits is unable to reproduce until their third month of life, but after that produces a new pair of rabbits each month. Thus, in the first and second months, there is one pair of rabbits on the island, but in the third month, there are two pairs of rabbits, as the first pair has a pair of offspring. In the fourth month, the original pair of rabbits is still there, as is their first pair of offspring, which are not yet mature enough to reproduce. However, the original pair gives birth to another pair of rabbits, meaning that the island now has three pairs of rabbits. Assuming that there are no rabbit-killing predators on the island and the rabbits have an indefinite lifespan, how many pairs of rabbits are on the island in the tenth month?</div>
