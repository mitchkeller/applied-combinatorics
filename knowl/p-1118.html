<div class="para">Much of our motivation for solving recurrence equations comes from an analogous problem in continuous mathematics—differential equations. You don’t need to have studied these beasts before in order to understand what we will do in the remainder of this chapter, but if you have, the motivation for how we tackle the problems will be clearer. As their name suggests, differential equations involve derivatives, which we will denote using “operator” notation by <span class="process-math">\(Df\)</span> instead of the Leibniz notation <span class="process-math">\(df/dx\text{.}\)</span> In our notation, the second derivative is <span class="process-math">\(D^2 f\text{,}\)</span> the third is <span class="process-math">\(D^3 f\text{,}\)</span> and so on. Consider the following example.</div>
