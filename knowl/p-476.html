<div class="para">Suppose three new homes are being built and each of them must be provided with utility connections. The utilities in question are water, electricity, and natural gas. Each provider needs a direct line from their terminal to each house (the line can zig-zag all it wants, but it must go from the terminal to the house without passing through another providerâ€™s terminal or another house en route), and the three providers all wish to bury their lines exactly four feet below ground. Can they do this successfully without the lines crossing?</div>
