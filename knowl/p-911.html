<div class="para">A soccer teamâ€™s equipment manager is in a hurry to distribute uniforms to the last six players to show up before a match. Instead of ensuring that each player receives his own uniform, he simply hands a uniform to each of the six players. In how many ways could he hand out the uniforms so that no player receives his own uniform?  (Assume that the six remaining uniforms belong to the last six players to arrive.)</div>
