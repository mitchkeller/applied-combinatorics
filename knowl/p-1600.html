<div class="para">As an example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flowapplications_bip_match.html" title="Figure 14.3">Figure 14.3</a>, the thick edges form a matching from <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V_2\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that you’re the manager of these workers (on the bottom) and must assign them to the jobs (on the top). Are you really making the best use of your resources by only putting four of six workers to work? There are no trivial ways to improve the number of busy workers, as the two without responsibilities right now cannot do any of the jobs that are unassigned. Perhaps there’s a more efficient assignment that can be made by redoing some of the assignments, however. If there is, how should you go about finding it? If there is not, how would you justify to your boss that there’s no better assignment of workers to jobs?</div>
